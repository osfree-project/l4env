This directory contains patches for various experiments:

patch-ResourceReservation: used to specify resources required
  by a server. An extra option was added to turn on generation
  of a resource reservation function. This function talks to
  the qos_mgr (see l4/pkg/qos_mgr). The request string for the
  QoS Manager is generated by Dice.
