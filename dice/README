Read Me First file for DICE (DROPS IDL Compiler) Project

Welcome
=======
 Dice is an IDL compiler for the L4 microkernel. It translates CORBA IDL and
DCE IDL files into L4 specific communication stubs.  To be able to support L4
specific IPC, some special types and attributes have been added to the IDLs.

Compiling for the first time:
=============================
 If you have checked out a fresh version from the remote SVN, you will have
noticed that there is no Makefile. Please run

'make -f Makefile.drops',

which invokes the bootstrap script, then configure, and eventually make again
to build Dice. On platforms other than default Linux installations, you might
want to rerun the bootstrap script (you will need to have the auto* tools
installed).

 If you obtained a tarball or zip file, unpack the compressed file. Change
into the generated directory (dice-<version>) and call './configure', which
will test your local build environment and generate appropriate Makefiles.
Then simply run 'make'.
