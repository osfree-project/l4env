Read Me First file for DICE (DROPS IDL Compiler) Project

Welcome
=======
 Dice is an IDL compiler for the L4 microkernel. It translates CORBA IDL and
DCE IDL files into L4 specific communication stubs.  To be able to support L4
specific IPC, some special types and attributes have been added to the IDLs.

Compiling for the first time:
=============================
 If you have checked out a fresh version from the remote CVS, you will have
noticed that there is no Makefile. Please run

'make -f Makefile.drops', 

which invokes the bootstrap script, then configure, and eventually make again
to build Dice. If you wish to configure Dice manually, run the bootstrap
script first to create the configure script.

 If you obtained a tarball or zip file, unpack the compressed file. Change
into the generated directory (dice-<version>) and call './configure', which
will test your local build environment and generate appropriate Makefiles.
Then simply run 'make'.

Used Header Files
=================
 Dice comes with some header files (include directory), which are used to
compile IDL files and in the generated files.  When compiling IDL files you
may (unlikely) encounter the following error:

"<idlfile>:1: dice/dice-corba-types.h: No such file or directory"

Add the path to the Dice include directory to the include paths with the -I
option.

Bugs
====
 To report bugs, send an email to dice@os.inf.tu-dresden.de or

Packaged Versions
=================
 There may exist packages for Dice. Refer to the Dice homepage for the latest
information (http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/dice/).

Mailinglist
===========
 There exists a low-traffic mailinglist for Dice related stuff: to subscribe

or question, send an email to dice@os.inf.tu-dresden.de.
