Read Me First file for DICE (DROPS IDL Compiler) Project

Welcome
=======
 Dice is an IDL compiler for the L4 microkernel. It translates
CORBA IDL and DCE IDL files into L4 specific communication stubs.
To be able to support L4 specific IPC, some special types and
attributes have been added to the IDLs.

 Currently Dice supports only the V2 ABI of the L4 microkernel,
but work is under way to add support for the X0 and X2/V4 ABIs
asap.

Compiling for the first time:
=============================
 If you have checked out a fresh version from the remote CVS,
you will have noticed that there is no Makefile. Please run
'make -f Makefile.cvs', 
which invokes the bootstrap script, then configure, and 
eventually make again to build Dice. If you wish to configure 
Dice manually, run the bootstrap script first to create the 
configure script.

 If you obtained a tarball or zip file, unpack the compressed
file. Change into the generated directory (dice-<version>) and
call './configure', which will test your local build environment
and generate appropriate Makefiles. Then simply run 'make'.

Compiling for DROPS Environment
===============================
 If you have checked out a fresh version from the (remote) CVS,
and wish to build all the Makefiles and Dice for the DROPS build
environment using DROPS_STDDIR, you can do so buy running
'make -f Makefile.drops', 
which performs the same steps as above, but uses the variable 
DROPS_STDDIR as prefix for configure. DROPS_STDDIR is set in 
$(L4DIR)/Makeconf.local.

Used Header Files
=================
 Dice comes with some header files (include directory), which
are used to compiler IDL files and in the generated files.
Typically they are installed into $(L4DIR)/include/dice. If
no L4 build environment exists, no header files are locally
installed. When compiling IDL files this may lead to an 
error:
"<idlfile>:1: dice/dice-corba-types.h: No such file or directory"
Add the path to the Dice include to the include paths with
the -I option.
(If you have an older version of Dice installed, make sure,
its header files are not included.)

Thanx for using DICE (let's roll the dice)
