Changes in 2.2.9
----------------
 - better support for C++: -BmCPP generates .cc/.hh files and g++ comformant
   code
 - support AMD64 for V2 using C Bindings (-Bpamd64)
 - specify output directory using -o Option
 - removed optimization (-O) option (unused)
 - some bug-fixes


Changes in 2.2.8
----------------
 - replaced Vector and String class by STL implementations
 - made usage of 'long long' type detectable by configure script
 - configure checks for existence of 'long long' type and 'atoll' function
 - added option to align parameters in the message buffer to the size of their
   type
 - starting support for L4 V4 (aka X2) ABI
 - add function attribute [allow_reply_only] for asynchronous servers
 - add function attribute [noopcode] to not sent opcodes
 - add function attribute [noexceptions] to not sent exceptions
 - add option -fno-dispatcher to not generate the dispatcher
   function
	       
Changes in 2.2.7
----------------
 - split server-loop function into a simpler server-loop
   and a dispatch function
 - added option to not generate server loop function
 - added CORBA Common Data Representaion (CDR) back-end
      
Changes in 2.2.6
----------------
 - type-attributes in C parser
 - ARM backend for X0
 - sequence type supported
 - CORBA string mapping fixed
 - [in] arrays are const arguments now
 - exceptions supported for system-exceptions
   . IPC error
   . wrong opcode
 - unified CORBA types into one header
 - generates only C files for IDL file given as argument

Changes in 2.2.5
----------------
 - some more magic for the CORBA types:
   . configure sets the l4dir and the include path where dice includes are
     installed to
   . dice adds them to the include paths with "/dice" added
     -> thus /usr/include and $(L4DIR)/include are no longer added automatically
        but /usr/include/dice and $(L4DIR)/include/dice instead
   . adapted automatic include of "dice/dice-corba-types.h" appropriately
   . added possibility to mark a file as "privately included" meaning that no
     #include statement will appear for it in generated files
     -> "dice-corba-types.h" will not appear in generated files

Changes in 2.2.4
----------------
 - bug fix release for 2.2.3
 - fixes problems introduced with new parser architecture
 - import and include behave (almost) the same now
 - smaller fixes for [oneway]
 - SOCKETAPI -> L4API_linux
 - some gcc adaption to gcc-c front-end
      
Changes in 2.2.3
----------------
 - several bug-fixes
 - enhanced front-end with a seperate C parser

Changes in 2.2.2
----------------
 - tons of bug-fixes
 - x0 Back-End added (untested)
 - x0adaption Back-End added (imitates V2 API on X0 kernel)
 - generated stubs partially contain inline assembler
 - added user's manual
 - unified some examples
 - CORBA_Object usage compatible to CORBA C Language Mapping now
 - bug fixes
