This is the main index for the comp.compilers server.  It lists the
various files available from the server.  Everything available from the
mail server is also available from the FTP archive at primost.cs.wisc.edu.
Please use the FTP archive if you can, to avoid overloading the single
modem that connects the mail server to the outside world.

All of the back messages from comp.compilers are available.  The
comp.compilers message index is in a separate file for each year with
the names index86, index87, etc.  You can get the files via, e.g.:

	send index90

Each message has an ID number of the form YY-MM-NNN where YY and MM are
the year and month and NNN is the message number within the month.  Some
message numbers may appear more than once if the message is a digest, a
few messages were cancelled and do not appear at all.  The index is
updated daily.  This is the file "index", listing other available files.

The message index files contain all of the Subject: lines (with "Re:"
edited out) and the message ID and number of lines in lines of the
message.

You can retrieve messages by message ID.  For example, to get the third
message from January 1991, send a message containing this line:

	send 91-01-003


There are some other files available as well:
