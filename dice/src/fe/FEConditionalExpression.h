 *  \brief represents a conditional expression
 *
 * This class is used to represent a conditional expression. This
 * kind of expression consits of an expression, which evaluates to a
 * boolean value. Is this boolen value true, contains the second expression
 * the value, which stands for the whole expression. Is the boolean expression
 * false, is the value of the whole expression the value of the third expression.
 *
 * \todo optimize: if condition is constant, we can already decide which expression
 * to use
