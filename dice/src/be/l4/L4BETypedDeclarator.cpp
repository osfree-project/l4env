 * it should use for each parameter, this decision is also distributed accross the
 * whole back-end. This function has influence on the decision whether the message buffer
 * is variable sized or fixed sized. Which again influences the way the parameters and
 * especially this parameter is marshalled. Therefore we have to be careful about
 * which policies to distribute across the back-end.
 *
 * This implementation first checks if the base class thinks this is a variable sized
 * parameter. If it is not than we have no objection. If it is variable sized then we
 * test for ref-strings (the [string] attribute is optional and determines the use of
 * strlen). Refstrings - in contrary to "normal" strings - are not marshalled as
 * variable sized arrays, but as fixed sized value-pair of start-address and size.
 * Therefore they are not variable sized.
