2.2.7
 - split server-loop function into a simpler server-loop
   and a dispatch function
 - added option to not generate server loop function
 - added CORBA Common Data Representaion (CDR) back-end

2.2.6
 - type-attributes in C parser
 - ARM backend for X0
 - sequence type supported
 - CORBA string mapping fixed
 - [in] arrays are const arguments now
 - exceptions supported for system-exceptions
   . IPC error
   . wrong opcode
 - unified CORBA types into one header
 - generates only C files for IDL file given as argument

2.2.5
- some more magic for the CORBA types:
  . configure sets the l4dir and the include path where dice includes are	
    installed to
  . dice adds them to the include paths with "/dice" added
    -> thus /usr/include and $(L4DIR)/include are no longer added automatically
       but /usr/include/dice and $(L4DIR)/include/dice instead
  . adapted automatic include of "dice/dice-corba-types.h" appropriately
  . added possibility to mark a file as "privately included" meaning that no
    #include statement will appear for it in generated files
    -> "dice-corba-types.h" will not appear in generated files

2.2.4
 - bug fix release for 2.2.3
 - fixes problems introduced with new parser architecture
 - import and include behave (almost) the same now
 - smaller fixes for [oneway]
 - SOCKETAPI -> L4API_linux
 - some gcc adaption to gcc-c front-end

2.2.3
