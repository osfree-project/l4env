Plain text looks like this.
Paragraph 1 is here.
Paragraph 2 should be here.
Use 'apostrophes for monospaced text', but #hash# works too for compatibility.

BUG appears if a new line starts with non-words.
BUG this should be a new paragraph, but it is'nt.

There was a bug where an

There was also a bug where a
[reference] caused the start of a new paragraph.
There was even a bug where a
"quotes" caused the start of a new paragraph.
Just to test, how -- and --- are handled by the backend.
BTW, what happens when they appear inside [refer --- ences]?
