        Description of the GOSH backend for Technical Reports

                            Norman Feske

The 'techreport.gosh' backend creates a document that is compliant with the
layout of the Technical Reports of the TU Dresden. It prepends a front page
with the usual graphics of the skyline of Dresden and the TUD-Logo. If you
want to create a Technical Report, just copy the files 'dresden.pdf',
'siggraph.cls' and 'tu11.pdf' to the directory where your paper resides and
call gosh via:

! gosh --style /where/gosh/lives/techreport.gosh \
!      --trnum "TUD-FIXX-XX-März 2024" \
!      your_paper.txt > your_paper.tex

Now simply run pdflatex with the resulting tex file.

Thanks to Michael Hohmuth and Hendrik Tews for supplying the Latex layout
stuff.
