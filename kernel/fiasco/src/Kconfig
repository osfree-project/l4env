config SCHED_PIT
	bool "Use PIT for scheduling"
	depends on PF_PC || PF_UX
	help
	  Normally, Fiasco uses the RTC at IRQ8 for scheduling. This can be
	  disadvantageous in certain circumstances, e.g. VMWare doesn't seem
	  to emulate the RTC good enough so that not enough timer interrupts
	  are produced. The PIT mode (using IRQ0) seems to work better in
	  this case.  It is generally safe to use this option, so if you are
	  unsure, say 'Y'.

	  Consider that the interrupt priorities change: Using RTC, IRQ8 has
	  the highest priority. Using PIT, IRQ0 has the highest priority.
	  The only case where PIT scheduling does not work is with
	  profiling. If profiling is enabled the PIT is used for generating
	  the profiling interrupts.

config SCHED_RTC
	bool "Use RTC for scheduling"
	depends on PF_PC
	help
	  'Yes' is the standard for this option. If this option is set
	  Fiasco uses the RTC on IRQ 8 for scheduling.  This can be
	  disadvantageous in certain circumstances, e.g. VMWare doesn't seem
	  to emulate the RTC good enough so that not enough timer interrupts
	  are produced.  The PIT (8254) mode (say 'no' here), seems to work
	  better in this case. It is generally safe to use the PIT, so if
	  you are unsure, say 'no'.
	  Consider that the interrupt priorities change: Using RTC, IRQ8 has
	  the highest priority. Using PIT, IRQ0 has the highest priority.
	  The only case where PIT scheduling does not work is with
	  profiling. If profiling is enabled the PIT is used for generating
	  the profiling interrupts and the RTC must be used for scheduling.
	  In the case where profiling shall be used within VMWare the
	  SLOW_RTC option must be set, so that the timer resolution of
	  Fiasco is reduced to 100Hz.

config SCHED_APIC

	  If you use Fiasco for high assurance, high security and use AMD

	  harm to disable it.

config REGPARM3

config PL0_HACK
	bool "PL0 Hack"
	depends on PF_PC && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Allows a user task to gain system privileges.
	  DO NOT ENABLE THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

config TASK_CAPS
	bool "Enable task capabilities"
	help
	  Enabling this option adds task-send capabilities to the kernel.
	  IPC is allowed only if the sender task owns a capability for the
	  receiver task.

config USER_LOCKS
	bool "Enable support for user-level locks"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && TASK_CAPS
	help
	  Enable this option if you want to use l4_ulock or l4_usem calls
	  for kernel-provided user-level locks (FAST).

config ASSEMBLER_IPC_SHORTCUT
	bool "Assembler IPC shortcut"
	default y

	  Use the assembler IPC shortcut to get even better short IPC

config CONTEXT_4K

	  4KB.

config IO_PROT
	bool "Enable I/O port protection"
	default y
	depends on PF_PC
	help
	  Enabling this option adds I/O port protection to the kernel. That
	  means that every thread starts running at IOPL 0 which means that
	  only the kernel has full access to all I/O ports. This includes
	  the right to set and clear the interrupt flags (that is using cli
	  and sti). Access rights to I/O ports can be mapped like memory. If
	  a task has access to the whole I/O port space, its IOPL is raised
	  to 3 allowing the task to use cli and sti.

config IO_PROT_IOPL_3
	bool "Enable CLI/STI (IOPL 3)"
	depends on PF_PC && IO_PROT
	help
	  Enable IOPL 3 for tasks with access to all I/O ports, this is the

config SLOW_RTC

	  This option should be enabled if you use VMWare and no PIT

config ONE_SHOT

config SYNC_TSC

	help
	  Synchronize the internal kernel clock with the CPU time stamp
	  counter.

config FINE_GRAINED_CPUTIME
	bool "Fine-grained CPU time"
	depends on PF_PC && IA32
	help
	  Measure CPU time consumed by a thread from switching to the thread
	  until switching to another thread. Induces an overhead during each
	  thread switch, so only activate it for debugging.

config UX_CON
	bool "Graphical console (requires SDL library!)"
	depends on PF_UX
	help
	  Fiasco-UX can supply a graphical console for the L4 program it is
	  running.  Enabling this option will build the additional program
	  but needs the SDL library including development header files
	  installed.

config UX_NET
	bool "Network support"
	depends on PF_UX
	help
	  Enabling this option makes Fiasco-UX provide network support for
	  L4 programs.

config INLINE
	bool "Generate inline code"
	default y
	help
	  Inlining specifies that it is desirable for the compiler to
	  integrate functions declared 'inline' into the calling routine.
	  This usually leads to faster code, so unless you want to debug the
	  kernel you should say 'Y' here.

config NDEBUG
	bool "Do not compile assertions"
	help
	  Don't insert assertions into the code. Should be enabled for
	  kernels which are used for measurements.

config PROFILE
	bool "Compile with profiling support"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && PF_PC && IA32 && !ASSEMBLER_IPC_SHORTCUT && SCHED_RTC && !NO_FRAME_PTR
	help
	  This option enables support for kernel profiling. This implies
	  that a special CPU lock is used, because profiling IRQ must be
	  enabled even in cases where a CPU lock is locked. So the
	  cpu_lock-pic module is used as implementation for the lock.
	  Further this option does not work with PIT scheduling
	  (CONFIG_SCHED_PIT) because the PIT is used for generating
	  profiling IRQs.

config NO_FRAME_PTR
	bool "Compile without frame pointer"
	help
	  Enabling this option optimizes for speed but makes debugging more
	  difficult.

config STACK_DEPTH
	bool "Measure stack depth of threads"
	help
	  When this option is enabled, each thread control block is marked
	  with magic numbers while creation. The function ``show thread
	  lists'' scans the TCB for these magic numbers and shows the
	  currently used depth of each thread.

config LIST_ALLOC_SANITY
	bool "Sanity checks in low level allocator"
	help
	  When this option is enabled the low level memory allocator does
	  extra sanity checks on its data structures before and after every
	  operation. This can halp detect  flaws like double frees or memory
	  corruption by other means.

	  These tests are very expensive so only enable them if a problem
	  with memory allocation is expected.

config BEFORE_IRET_SANITY
	bool "Sanity checks at syscall entry/exit"
	depends on PF_PC
	help
	  Perform the following additional sanity checks before returning to
	  usermode:
	    - Does the thread hold any locks?
	    - Is the thread locked by any other thread?
	    - Does the thread have the right state:
	      * Thread_ready must be set.
	      * Thread_cancel and Thread_fpu_owner might be set.
	      * Any other state bit must not be set.
	  Don't use Fiasco compiled with this option for performance analysis!

config GSTABS
	bool "Compile with gstabs+ debugging information"
	default y
	depends on (PF_PC || PF_UX) && IA32
	help
	  Enabling this option includes the debugging information using the
	  older gstabs+ format into the kernel image. This is necessary to
	  access line number information of the kernel from JDB.

config WATCHDOG
	bool "Enable Watchdog support"
	default y
	depends on PF_PC && IA32
	help
	  Enable support for watchdog using the builtin Local APIC and a

	  -watchdog command line option.

config JDB_LOGGING
	bool "JDB extended logging"
	depends on IA32
	help
	  There are two classes of logging events: Basic events don't
	  consume any time if they are disabled (ipc, ipc result,
	  pagefaults, unmap). Extended logging events add an additional
	  overhead of most probably less than 10 cycles if they are
	  disabled. These events can be activated/deactivated by the 'O'
	  command in jdb.

	  Should be disabled for kernels which are used for measurements.

config JDB_ACCOUNTING
	bool "JDB accounting"
	depends on IA32
	help
	  Enable accounting information about IPCs, context switches, page
	  faults, and other events. The counters are accessible from
	  userland through the tbuf status page.

	  Should be disabled for kernels which are used for measurements.
