/*
 * This module implements a simple "global critical region"
 * used throughout the OS toolkit to ensure proper serialization
 * for various "touchy" but non-performance critical activities
 * such as panicking, rebooting, debugging, etc.
 * This critical region can safely be entered recursively;
 * the only requirement is that "enter"s match exactly with "leave"s.
 *
 * The implementation of this module is machine-dependent,
 * and generally disables interrupts and, on multiprocessors,
 * grabs a recursive spin lock.
