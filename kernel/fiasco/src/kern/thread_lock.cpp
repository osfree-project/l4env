/** Thread lock.  
    This lock uses the basic priority-inheritance mechanism (Switch_lock)
    and extends it in two ways: First, it has a hinting mechanism that
    allows a locker to specify whether the clear() operation should 
    switch to the thread that was locked.  Second, it maintains the current
    locker for Context; this locker automatically gets CPU time allocated
    to the locked thread (Context's ``donatee''); 
    Context::switch_to() uses that hint.
