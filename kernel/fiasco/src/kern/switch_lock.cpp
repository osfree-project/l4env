 * may disappear while it is locked (see clear_no_switch_dirty() and 
 * switch_dirty()), even if it is under contention. When the lock no longer
 * exists VALID::valid(void const *lock) must return false, true if it
 * exists (see Switch_lock_valid). This mechanism is used in Thread_lock
 * when thread control blocks are deallocated.
 *
 * The operations lock(), lock_dirty(), try_lock(), test(), test_and_set(),
 * and test_and_set_dirty() may return #Invalid if the lock does 
 * no longer exist.
 *
 * The operations initialize(), lock_owner(), clear(), clear_dirty(), and
 * clear_no_switch_dirty() must not being called on and invalid lock,
 * thus the lock itself must be held for using these operations. 
 * (Except initialize(), which is only useful for locks that are always 
 * valid.)
 * 
 * @param VALID must be set to a validity checker for the lock.
 * 
 * The validity checker is used while aquiring the lock to test
 * if the lock itself existis. We assume that a lock may disappear
 * while we are blocked on it.
