	* Synchronized with 2.4.0-test5

Release 0.7.4: Wed Jul 26 12:07:47 EDT 2000
	* Randy Dunlap has certified the USB configuration.
	* 'x' and 'q' reversed in curses and tty modes.  'q' now matches
	  the semantics of the Tk Quit menu entry.
	* We no longer write FOO=n in defconfig; this turned out
	  to break a large number of ifdefs in old-style makefiles 
	  in the Linux kernel tree.

	* Fixed a bug in -i handling.

Release 0.6.4: Wed Jul  5 17:08:35 EDT 2000
	* Symbols with help are now marked in the curses front end.
	* Rulebase is synchronized with 2.4.0-test2.

	  considered and dropped.

Release 0.6.3: Wed Jul  5 08:23:11 EDT 2000
	* Dynamic resizing of the panel works now.  It seems to interfere

	  and "Show dependents of..." functions.

Release 0.6.2: Tue Jul  4 21:20:20 EDT 2000

	* Abolished the configsymbol lexical class.
	* Rulebase corrections for HP300 by Tamminen Eero.
	* Don't croak on a malformed -i or -I file.
	* Fixed bugs in curses mode g and / commands.

Release 0.5.3: Fri Jun 30 10:35:10 EDT 2000
	* Fixed an extremely obscure bug in side-effect propagation 
	  pointed out by Simon Vogl.

	* -E (elision) option becomes -S (suppression) option.
	* ^G now does an exit and revert to initial value when field editing
	  in curses mode.
	* Fixed a subtle compiler error that screwed up the processing of
	  "suppress depends" -- it now propagates down through menus as
	  it should.
	* Value stacking is now implemented; see the end of section IV.4, 
	  "Symbol Assignment and Side Effects", for discussion.
	* Bugs in configuration saving fixed.  Among other things, derived
	  symbols are written out properly now.

Release 0.3.5: Mon Jun 12 12:11:55 EDT 2000
	* Stutter bug solved; we now have range validation in the Tk mode.
	* Rules changes by Andrzej Krzysztofowicz.
	* First translation section certified -- NLS, by Urban Widmark.

	  last round of refactoring.

Release 0.3.0: Fri Jun  9 16:52:10 EDT 2000
	* Complete rewrite of the deduction algorithm. It is now guaranteed
	  to find all side effects.  Deduction algorithm is now documented,
	  with an explanation of why it isn't a full SAT algorithm.
	* Field-mode editing help now actually works :-)

Release 0.2.13: Thu Jun  8 17:56:34 EDT 2000

	  redisplayed properly on rollback.

Release 0.2.10: Mon Jun  5 05:24:29 EDT 2000
	* Fix for typo reported by Giacomo Catenazzi.

Release 0.2.9: Sun Jun  4 22:36:17 EDT 2000
	* Choice menu bugfix by André Dahlqvist.
	* It is now possible to flag a symbol so that it will appear as
	  a warning in the prompts of all symbols that transitively
	  depend on it.  Currently this is used for "EXPERIMENTAL".

Release 0.2.8: Sun Jun  4 18:29:42 EDT 2000
	* Nicer scrolling behavior in the curses front end.

Release 0.2.7: Sun Jun  4 12:38:08 EDT 2000
	* Tk frontend now has a toolbar button to get at choice menu help.
	  (using the CML1 convention of attaching it to the first symbol).
	* Disabled special treatment of KEY_UP and KEY_DOWN when browsing help;
	  they now scroll up or down one line consistently.
	* File loads work, and now report syntax errors in the defconfigs.

Release 0.2.6: Sat Jun  3 17:43:41 EDT 2000
	* Better handling of message items.  USB menu looks really spiffy now!
	* Yet another swing at getting the timing of default-setting on choice
	  menus right.  This is the bug behind a lot of the constraint 
	  violations people have been reporting.
	* Sanity check on exit.

Release 0.2.5: Sat Jun  3 13:29:39 EDT 2000
	* Fix brown-paper-bag bug in dependency handling.

Release 0.2.4: Sat Jun  3 05:04:41 EDT 2000
	* André Dahlqvist contributed some fixes for the Search, Load and
	  Save commands; they behave better on error now.
	* There is now a built-in event logger in the curses mode.  I hope this
	  will enable us to catch and kill the out-of-range selection crashes
	  that several early testers have reported.  If this mode crashes on
	  you, please email me the configure.log file it leaves behind.
	* Fixed Urban Widmark's restore-on-pop bug.  It's possible this was
	  the one causing the crashes...
	* Totally rewrote the logic for forcing values in ancestors and
	  descendants.  It's cleanly separated from the constraint stuff
	  now and works much better.
	* Choices menu defaults are handled differently now.  An effect of
	  this is that it should no longer be possible to save a 
	  configuration that fails constraints because no architecture is
	  set.

Release 0.2.3: Fri Jun  2 03:35:54 EDT 2000
	* Found and optimized away the quadratic search that was making
	  0.2.2 painfully slow.
	* Correct checkbuttons for boolean values.

Release 0.2.2: Thu Jun  1 19:42:20 EDT 2000
	* Added condition-on statement.  Module value support can now
	  be tied to a symbol (MODULES, in the Linux kernel ruleset).
	  If module values are off, the front end doesn't present
	  m as an alternative for trit symbols.
	* No confirm on quit unless you've actually changed a symbol
	  since the last save.
	* Fix some errors in range computation introduced by the
	  trit switch change.
	* Speed optimization for elision computations (mainly affects
	  tty mode, which uses the elision check for skip to next query).

Release 0.2.1: Wed May 31 23:50:07 EDT 2000
	* Added Load command to Tk version, i and I commands to curses mode.
	* Added Freeze command to Tk mode
	* Added / search command to the curses interface.
	* Selection is no longer reset to top of screen on a redraw.

Release 0.2.0: Wed May 31 16:53:34 EDT 2000
	* Full atemporal deduction with a baby theorem prover!
	* Whenever/sets are gone from the language.  Those deductions
	  are now done directly from requires.
	* Setting a symbol may now set symbols in its visibility guard,
	  if we can deduce that relationals in the guard must be true.

Release 0.1.11: Tue May 30 19:55:11 EDT 2000
	* Beginnings of atemporal deduction.

Release 0.1.10: Tue May 30 17:36:13 EDT 2000
	* Improved error handling.

Release 0.1.9: Tue May 30 15:11:07 EDT 2000

	* On-line help and navigation bar.
	* Internal pager for tty-mode help.
	* Save As, Goto and Search commands.
	* Padding around popup windows in curses mode.

Release 0.1.7: Tue May 29 10:24:50 EDT 2000
	* Add confirm dialog on exit without saving.
	* Fix brown-paper-bag-bug with configuration saving.

Release 0.1.6: Mon May 29 22:19:05 EDT 2000
	* Tk mode knows about bools now and excludes 'm' value.
	* Can now edit string, hex, and decimal symbols (with validation!)
	* curses mode now has a working 'g' command.
	* It is now possible to toggle whether suppressed symbols are displayed
	  or not.
	* New `icon' declaration.
	* -x now forces Tk mode.  The debug option is now -d.

Release 0.1.5: Sat May 27 02:54:09 EDT 2000
	* Repacking when a menu is incrementally updated due to
	  visibility changes now works.

Release 0.1.4: Fri May 26 18:43:39 EDT 2000
	* Help buttons now work.

Release 0.1.3: Fri May 26 16:57:14 EDT 2000
	* Added `prohibit'.
	* The whenever statement changed; now allows full expressions on the
	  right-hand side of assignments, but each assignment requires
	  a leading "set" keyword.
	* Almost-working Tkinter interface (can't edit string or integer
	  symbols yet; doesn't really know trits from booleans).
	* Don't rely on DISPLAY, run xdpyinfo instead.
	* Fixes for Giacomo Catenazzi's bugs.
	* Incorporated many suggestions from Riley Williams.
	* Added -V option.

Release 0.1.2: Thu May 25 03:05:40 EDT 2000
	* Demonstration of the top-level menu in Tkinter.
	* Fixed bug in setting of final symbols.
	* Improvements in the language description

Release 0.1.1: Wed May 24 13:29:09 EDT 2000
	* Suggestions by John Cowan:
		radiomenu -> choices
		when -> whenever
	* Configurator now pops up a demonstration window in TkInter mode.

Release 0.1.0: Wed May 24 12:01:10 EDT 2000
	* Initial beta release.  Working line-oriented and curses modes;
	  no Tk interface yet.
