			TO DO:

* Can we detect the processor type on minx yet?

* Write up explanations of the tags and the autoconfigurator,
  also a kernel-hacker's guide to config maintainance.

* Look at Red Hat's sndconfig for sound card probes.  Giacomo suggests we
  should wait on this until ALSA comes in, as that may make matters simpler.

* Better reasoning about disjuncts in suppress/depend guards.  We should be 
  able to force a symbol in a disjunct if all the others are frozen.

* Enable the menu-bar stuff in treeconfig.

* Add suppression state information to top of screen in xconfig and menuconfig.

* Tk interface bugs:

If you're running KDE 2.1.1 with the dock bar extension, the dock bar 
may swallow your CML2 instance.  The reason for this is unknown
There's probably something deep in Tkinter that is weirdly fux0red, but
that code is a nasty swamp.  Urgh...

* One proposal for supporting internationalization at runtime:

import locale, translations
# Get the first two chars of the users current locale, so en_UK and
# en_US both use the en dictionary.
loc = locale.setlocale(locale.LC_CTYPE, "")[0:2]
try:
        lang = getattr(translations, loc)
except:
        lang = getattr(translations, 'en')

* More features for the Adventure interface:

Thief periodically materializes and steals some of your options.
Dwarf occasionally throws a sharp nasty knife at you.
Symbols with sub-configuration options are containers.
Monsters are summoned by constraint violations.

Monsters:
A large green fierce snake, barring the way,
The wumpus.
A killer rabbit
A fairy penguin
A rabid gnu
Chuck, the BSD daemon
The Death of Rats
The Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal
Clippy
Hello Kitty
A Slashdot troll
Lord Crud
