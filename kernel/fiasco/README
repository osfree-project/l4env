Welcome to Fiasco 1.0!
----------------------

Fiasco is a new microkernel intended to be compatible with the L4 microkernel
for x86. It implements the L4 ABI as defined in the L4/x86 Reference Manual,
which can be found at: http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/L4/bib.html

The Fiasco kernel can be used to construct flexible systems. We at TU Dresden
will use it as a base for our DROPS system which supports running real-time
and time-sharing applications concurrently on one computer. However, Fiasco
is not only suitable for big and complex systems, but also for small,
embedded applications.

Fiasco is freely redistributable under the GPL (see l4/kernel/fiasco/COPYING).
For different licensing schemes please contact us at:
  fiasco-core@os.inf.tu-dresden.de

For more details, see our webpage at: http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/fiasco/


Currently Fiasco supports the following architectures:

  - Intel and AMD IA-32 CPUs, i486 and above
  - A Linux usermode emulation of Fiasco/L4 (Fiasco-UX)

The following L4 ABIs are supported:

  - L4/v2 (version 2 of the L4 ABI)
  - L4/x0 (experimental version x0 of the L4 ABI)


Additional features like I/O-Flexpages and Small Address Spaces are also
implemented.

This distribution contains the Fiasco 1.0 microkernel, plus recent versions
of the following L4 software packages:

sigma0   - The L4 root pager
rmgr     - The L4 resource manager
hello    - A simple L4 application

For your convenience we also provide binaries from these packages for both
the X0 and V2 ABIs in the fiasco-1.0/l4/bin/ subdirectories.

Building Fiasco
---------------

To compile Fiasco you need gcc 2.95 or gcc 3.2, GNU binutils 2.12 or later,
GNU make and Perl version 5.6 or later. For the configuration tool you also
need python version 2.

Change to the directory fiasco-1.0/l4/kernel/fiasco/build and simply type
"make" without the quotes. This will build a standard IA-32 kernel. For other
configurations use "make menuconfig" to run the configuration tool.

For further information refer to: http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/fiasco/use.html

Building custom L4 binaries
---------------------------

If you intend to build your own L4 binaries, you will also need the OSKIT
tarball shipped with this version and flex and byacc. First build the OSKIT,
then build the L4 packages in fiasco-1.0/l4/pkg/ by typing "make".

Mailing List
------------

For problem reports and suggestions regarding the Fiasco microkernel,
please subscribe and send mail to the l4-hackers mailing list:

Remote CVS
----------

The latest development versions are available from our Remote-CVS server.
The truly bleeding edge will want to check out daily snapshots from there.
However, be aware that these may not always build or run correctly.

For information how to use Remote-CVS see:

Enjoy!
