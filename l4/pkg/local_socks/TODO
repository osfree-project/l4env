- also support SOCK_DGRAM (implement sendto(), recvfrom(), ...)
- there is no representation in the file system yet (no special file of type 'socket')
- getsockopt(), setsockopt() (for SO_LINGER)
- make shutdown(), close() honor SO_LINGER correctly
- async connect should have a timeout
- currently receive buffers need to be copied, if some_func_component() sets
  *_dice_reply = DICE_NOREPLY for asynchronous operation
