What's this?
------------

This package provides an L4VFS server for Unix domain sockets. It is not
finished yet, as it only implements SOCK_STREAM. Thus sendto(), recvfrom()
and recvmsg() are not implemented, as these are normally used in
conjunction with connection-less sockets like SOCK_DGRAM.
Most socket options and fcntl() flags are not available atm. However
blocking and non-blocking modes are supported, as well as select().


Requirements:
-------------

- names
- dm_phys
- log
- l4vfs
- name_server (from l4vfs)
- dietlibc
