/*!\brief Open a binary output channel
 *
 * \ingroup muxed_api
 *
 * This function opens a binary output channel at the logserver. Multiple
 * clients/programs can send data to the same output channel at the logserver,
 * the output is merged then. To do so, the clients must specify the same
 * channel nr when opening. A reference counter holds the number of
 * clients that opened that channel. Channel 1 is used for sending the
 * standard logging text on, using it for sending binary data is not
 * recommended.
 *
 * The caller of this function must specify a flexpage which is mapped to the
 * logserver. This flexpage is used for transfering data later when using
 * LOG_channel_write().
 *
 * \param  channel      channel nr of the channel to open
 * \param  fpage        a flexpage that will later be used for writing data.
 *			The flexpage must contain pinned pages prior to
 *			calling this function. The flexpage must not exceed
 *			2MB in its size.
 *
 * \retval >=0		the id of the connection to use later
 * \retval -L4_ENOMEM	the specified fpage exceeded the maximum size
 * \retval -L4_ENOMAP	if the server did not have a free area to receive the
 *			fpage or is otherwise short on resources
 * \retval -L4_EIPC	some problem with server communication occured
 * \retval -L4_EBUSY	the server is configured using normal mode,
 *                      not multiplexed mode for TCP-output. Sending binary
 *                      data to the client requires multiplexed output.  See
 *                      \ref p_server on how to configure multiplexed mode.
 *
 * \see  LOG_channel_write(), LOG_channel_close().

/*!\brief Send data to a binary output channel
 *
 * \ingroup muxed_api
 *
 * This function sends data to an open binary output channel at the
 * logserver. This function does not wait until the data is actually
 * sent. Therefore, you should not overwrite the data beeing sent,
 * until a subsequently call to LOG_channel_flush() returns.
 *
 * Multiple clients/programs can send to the same output channel at
 * the logserver, the output is merged then. It is ensured, that data
 * of different calls to LOG_channel_write() does not intercept each
 * other. When multiple clients/programs use the same channel, it is
 * recommended to use an additional encapsulation to demultiplex the
 * data lateron.
 *
 * \param  id	 id of the connection as returned from LOG_channel_open()
 * \param  off   offset of the data in the flexpage provided on
 *		 LOG_channel_open()
 * \param  size  number of bytes to write
 *
 * \retval 0  no error
 * \retval <0 in the case of error

 * becomes 0, the channel is actually closed, i.e. the resources are freed
 * in the logserver.
