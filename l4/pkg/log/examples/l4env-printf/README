This is an example for the usage of the logserver with printf and l4env.

Do not forget to load "dm_phys", as l4env currently (January 2003) requires
this for stack allocation. You should also load the "log" server. The
"names" server is essentioal for finding the other servers and must be
loaded. See the menu.lst file for an example that is working with the
current CVS.
