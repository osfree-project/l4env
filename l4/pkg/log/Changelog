0.6 - Frank, Jork
- added own set of printxxx-functions (logprintfxxx), which are used by the
  LOG-Macros. With the upcoming L4 console there was the wish to send
  standard printf-output to this l4 console, but to send log-macros to
  another instance as usual (screen, kernel debugger, LOG server). Therefore
  we needed different channels for output.  As nobody wanted to write a
  file-based implementation of print, we decided to use different functions,
  which could be overloaded/replaced by the linker.
