Log-Server for use with libl4log


- serializes log-requests from client-threads and prints them via
  printf() from oskit (current implementation: characterwise kdebug_out ?)

- needs nameserver started, registers as "stdlog"

- does not break long lines (todo?)

optional cmdline-argument: "--verbose"
  - prints the task- and threadid of the calling thread before each message
