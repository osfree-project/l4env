This directory contains the sources for the L4 Semaphore Library documentation. 

To create the documentation, run 'doxygen doxygen-refman.cfg' and 
'doxygen doxygen-internal.cfg', this will create the directories 
refman and internal.

- 'L4 Counting Semaphores Reference Manual' (refman/html/index.html)
  Information about how to use the Semaphore Library.

- 'L4 Counting Semaphores Source Code Documentation' 
  (internal/html/index.html)
