This package builds a library that implements BSD
socket interface and is based upon Linux 2.4 kernel
sources. The intention behind this package is to
have a set of generic code that each Linux network protocol
needs. It helps to port Linux kernel sources
of network protocols to L4.

Notes:

1. This lib needs some Linux 2.4 kernel sources.
2. DDE_Linux package is also needed.

Examples:

1. FLIPS package. It implements a complete TCP/IP stack.
2. PF_KEY_V2 package. It implementes RFC 2367
  "PF_KEY Key Management API, Version 2".
