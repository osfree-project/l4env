Root Memory Pager.

Sigma0 is the root pager which owns all physical memory at system startup.
All further mappings start at Sigma0. This implementation can be used
together with Fiasco (the L4 implementation of the Technische Universität
Dresden) and with the original L4 implementation by Jochen Liedtke which
was never available for public use).
