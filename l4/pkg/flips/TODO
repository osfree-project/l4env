* check BSD conformity of socket interface implementation
  * accept() was not handling accept(s,NULL,NULL) correctly -> hacked it
* libflips: client side IPC error detection/handling
* complete libflips API / flips idl overhaul
  * consider semantics of BSD socket API
  * design sane IDL
* doc/
  * Makefile
  * Kurzdoku zu liblinux
    * SOFTIRQS
* server/liblinux
  * Makefile
    * CFLAGS = -ffunction-sections
    * CFLAGS += -fno-strict-aliasing
  * Merge Makefile and Make.rules
  * Move oshkosh.c (later l4tun.c too) into own libs
    * Need not to rebuild Liblinux when reconfiguring
    * The server implementation chooses (dynamically) which backends are used
  * fix some XXX and FIXMEs
  * use at least l4util_rand() for get_random_bytes() in liblinux dummy.c
  * XXX temporarily switched of /proc support because of problems with
    sequential (virtual) files (fs/seq_file.c)
* server/src
  * FLIPS_DEBUG ?
* make config ?
* Why do L4Linux sources not work with FLIPS?
