FLIPS: FLexible IP-Stack for DROPS

FLIPS provides the standard BSD-socket interface to clients and is thereby a
full featured TCP/IP network stack supporting TCP, UDP and NETLINK for
configuration.

FLIPS is based on unmodified Linux 2.4 sources. It utilizes the DROPS Device
Driver Environment for Linux (dde_linux) and the Socket_Linux Package
(socket_linux). You need complete Linux sources in LINUX24_DIR as FLIPS does
not contain any Linux files.

ATTENTION: flips/Makefile does build FLIPS only if a valid LINUX24_DIR is set.
