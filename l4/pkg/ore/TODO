1                   Resolve performance lacks...
1a                  Adam: ORe does not fully utilize CPU?

2                   Client-side ORe drivers
2a      DONE        FLIPS driver (done by Christian)
2b      DONE        L4Linux driver  (thx Adam)
2c      DONE        TFTP driver		
2d      DONE        uIP stack driver

3                   we need a solution using dataspaces instead of string ipc, 
                    which will hopefully improve performance
                    - no local delivery yet
                    - implement lazy rxtx_entry copying

4                   incorporate more NIC drivers from Linux

5       DONE        build a version using dde_linux26 - This is absolutely
                    necessary, as GCC4 is not supported by 2.4 kernels

6       DONE        special case: packets for local ORe clients need to be 
                    delivered directly, because they will otherwise never be 
                    seen again by our NIC and therefore not reach their 
                    destination.

7       DONE        Adam wants to get the device's IRQ no. ==> client-level
                    configuration r/w and r/o

8       DONE        Make sure only one can request the original device MAC

9       DONE        Adam: We need to configure which legacy drivers are built 
                    into ORe, especially we need to be able to have none 
                    compiled in, so that local instances of ORe clients are
                    able to communicate in FiascoUX.

9b      DONE        Adam wants to integrate ORe and FiascoUX so that UX apps
                    can do networking.

10      DONE        Frank: the Tulip driver fails under high load leaving
                    ORe in an non-working state

11      DONE        Events support: killing an ORe client should result in
                    the client's connection being closed

12      DONE        MAC addresses need to be made unique

13      DONE        ORe hangs on send (??) after being idle for some time

14      DONE        Make ORe multi-threaded (one worker for each connection)

15                  Refactoring, Documentation:
                        - comment all functions
                        - get rid of way too long functions --> split
                            functionality
                        
16                  Split configuration struct:
                        - users only need to access the dataspaces, but
                          not the DSI stuff --> this should be kept by
                          the client library, so that the shmem implementation
                          is transparent to the user and can be replaced by something
                          more suitable than DSI

17      IMPORTANT   ORe-driver for ORe to support cascading
18      DONE	    command-line parameter to tell ORe which drivers should
                    be loaded (needed for cascading)
19      DONE	    tell L4Linux which ORe instance to use
