1                   Resolve performance lacks...

2                   Client-side ORe drivers
2a                  FLIPS driver
2b      DONE        L4Linux driver  (thx Adam)
2c      DONE        TFTP driver

3                   we need a solution using dataspaces instead of string ipc, 
                    which will hopefully improve performance

4                   incorporate more NIC drivers from Linux

5                   build a version using dde_linux26

6       DONE        special case: packets for local ORe clients need to be 
                    delivered directly, because they will otherwise never be 
                    seen again by our NIC and therefore not reach their 
                    destination.

7       DONE        Adam wants to get the device's IRQ no. ==> client-level
                    configuration r/w and r/o

8       DONE        Make sure only one can request the original device MAC

9                   Adam: We need to configure which legacy drivers are built 
                    into ORe, especially we need to be able to have none 
                    compiled in, so that local instances of ORe clients are
                    able to communicate in FiascoUX.

10                  Frank: the Tulip driver fails under high load leaving
                    ORe in an non-working state
