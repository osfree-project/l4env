Dynamic L4 Loader.

The loader is able to load L4 binaries at runtime. It works together with
the L4 exec server (see package exec) which is the binary interpreter.
Currently, only ELF binaries are supported. The loader accesses files using
the file provider interface as defined in the generic_fprov package.
