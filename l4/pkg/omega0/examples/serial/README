Example for omega0- use.

We configure com1 and com2 to communicate using IRQs. Every char received
will be echoed. IRQs occur on received and sent chars. Depending on the log
settings (especially at the omega0-server side) you will see more or less of
these internal details.

Special meanings of several chars:

d	- enter_kdebug
return	- return CR+LF
