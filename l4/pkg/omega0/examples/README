Some examples of Omega0 usage.

irqmeter - a meter that indicates incoming irqs.
Probably the easiest of the examples that shows best how to use Omega0.
Details of thread creation and memory management are hidden within l4env
libraries. see irqmeter/README

serial - serial communication
see serial/README

pit - a measurement tool to get Omega0 performance numbers
see pit/SPEED

delay - measure delay in interrupt propagation
This tool triggers an interrupt at the serial line while its interrupt is
disabled. Then it enables the interrupt at the pic, and measures the time
until it is signalled to the CPU.
