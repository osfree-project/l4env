To update this package do something like the following:

 mkdir foo
 cd foo
 tar xzf linux-2.4.xx.yy.tar.gz
 cd linux-2.4.xx.yy
 make oldconfig
 make dep
 cd include

 For now we only need i386 and x86_64 headers, so remove all "asm-" subdirs
 except "asm-i386", "asm-x86_64" and "asm-generic". (Also remove linux/modules!)

 Merge new version into this package under include.
