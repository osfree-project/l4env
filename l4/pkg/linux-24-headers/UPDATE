To update this package do something like the following:

 mkdir foo
 cd foo
 tar xzf linux-2.4.xx.tar.gz
 cd linux-2.4.xx
 make oldconfig
 make dep
 cd include

 For now we only need i386 headers, so remove all "asm-" subdirs
 except "asm-i386" and "asm-generic". (Also remove linux/modules!)

 cvs -d $CVSROOT import -I '!' -ko -m "Linux 2.4.xx headers" l4/pkg/linux-24-headers/include LINUX LINUX_2_4_xx

 Since we started to modify files in the include directory there'll
 be conflicts on imports now, some poor guy has to fix them...

 cd ../..
 cvs -d $CVSROOT checkout -jLINUX:yesterday -jLINUX l4/pkg/linux-24-headers/include

 Check for merging conflicts, solve them and commit your changes.
