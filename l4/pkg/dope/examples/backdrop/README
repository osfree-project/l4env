                               Norman Feske

This is an application that creates a background image for DOpE. The image used
is linked against the executable and must be named background.png. The image is
scaled to the screen size. Thus, it is recommended to use an image with the
same resolution as the used with DOpE. The image will be dithered and may have
artifacts when scaled. As indicated by the file extension, the image format
should be png.

This example is not build by default because it has external dependencies to
libpng, libz and libpng_wrap.

To use your own image, create an Makeconf.local and define a variable PICTURE
to point to your PNG file.
