Proxygon - an implementation of the DROPS console interface to be used with DOpE

This program enables you to execute arbitrary console programs under DOpE
without any modifications. It provides the identical interface as the original
console including the pSLIM protocol.

Anyhow, only a subset of the original console features is provided. Proxygen
will be enhanced by features on users demand.
