I/O server interface.

This package defines the generic interface of I/O managers. It is (like
dm_generic) not an implementation. generic_io includes a wrapper library libio.
This is the I/O manager API to be used in programs.

An I/O manager provides services to access I/O related resources. These
resources are (at least on x86) I/O port regions, memory-mapped I/O regions and
PCI configuration space. Interrupt handling is also in scope of an I/O manager
and handled as proposed for Omega0 (see omega0/doc/omega0.ps.gz). A brief Omega0
introduction is included in the manual (generic_io/doc/).
