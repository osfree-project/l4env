/*! \mainpage L4Env Generic I/O IPC Interface

\section sec_intro Introduction

The IPC interface is not needed in the `reference' because there is \c
libio. On the other side \c doxygen creates <em>lots of cruft around
nothing</em> to document IDLs and so I hate it in the `internals'.

Consequently I extracted the interface of the server and put it in here
for them who care about it.
