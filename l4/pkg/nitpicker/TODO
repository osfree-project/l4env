:Drag-and-drop:

  Implement drag-and-drop as described in the Nitpicker paper.

:Donation:

  Transfer the ownership of client memory to Nitpicker.
  Nitpicker needs to revoke the access rights from the client.

:Bug in view stacking when a new view is created:

  Under some conditions (still need to figure this out), new views
  may lead to inconsistent view layouts. For example:

  There are two clients, Scout and X11. An X-Term window is
  partly covered by the Scout window but still has the keyboard
  focus. We start X-Eyes by using the X-Term window and
  the new X-Eyes window appeard on top of both (Scout and X-Term)
  windows. Now, the stacking order of the X-Term window is
  somehow wrong.
