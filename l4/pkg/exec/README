L4 Executable Interpreter.

The L4 exec server interprets L4 binaries and creates appropriate dataspaces
containing the program sections. A binary may depend on a shared library which
is additionally loaded. For further documentation on how to start programs on
L4 see the loader package. For internal documentation of the exec package see
the doc directory.
