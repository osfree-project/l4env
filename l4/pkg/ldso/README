This package contains a ported ldso of the uClibc 0.9.27 which is
equivalent to ldso 1.9.11.

The L4 loader loads both the interpreter and the binary into the
application's address space and passes the control to the interpreter.
After relocating itself, the interpreter loads the program sections
(also sometimes called program segments) of all dependent shared
libraries using mmap(). The location of the program section is then
passed using the L4env infopage to the application. The region manager
of the application has to reserve these regions.
