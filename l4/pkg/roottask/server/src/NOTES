Debug Directives

The following directives only affect the resource-manager thread
(lthread 1), not the pager thread (lthread 0) of the Rmgr server task.

verbose

    Log all request and response messages for *failed* requests 
    (that is, for request to which RMGR responds with first_dword == -1).

debug

    As "verbose", but additionally enter the L4 kernel debugger every
    time a request fails.

debug_log MASK TYPES

    MASK is a bit vector containing a bit for each Rmgr protocol (bit
    0 -> RMGR_RMGR, bit 1 -> RMGR_MEM, bit 2 -> RMGR_TASK, 3 ->
    RMGR_IRQ; see <l4/server/rmgr.h>.  

    "debug_log" never does anything for a protocol whose bit has not
    been set in MASK.  If bit 1 of TYPES has also been set, action is
    further constrained to the request number specified in bits 31..16
    of TYPES.

    Apart from further constraining action to particular requests,
    TYPES also defines the kind of action to be taken.  In particular,
    the bits of TYPES have the following meanings:

    TYPES bit	 meaning

    31..16	 Specifies a request number action should be limited
		 to; for example, 1 means RMGR_TASK_ALLOC.  See
		 <l4/server/rmgr.h>.
		 This value is only meaningful when bit 1 is also set.

    2		 enter the kernel debugger.

    1		 Limit action to the request number specified by bits
		 31..16.  If not set, logging is enabled for all
		 request numbers.

    0		 Log request and response message.
