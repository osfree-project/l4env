currently known bugs:
- the debug system has to be fixed
- fiasco ux support has to be fixed
  --> fiasco support is now enabled 
  --> -d option for Fiasco-UX doesn't work, because of syntax change for cmdline
  -configuration, see next point
- the commandline configuration has to be fixed
  --> seems to be fixed now, config can be added after -- at the end of standard  options
- the RMGR-stage2 image debug information can't
  be extracted (this is because Stage2-Image is not
  copied with boot-modules by Stage1)
- the region.c is a hack to provide some sementics
  for reserved memmory regions, this should be changed 
  and somehow merged with names.c service
- when copying MBI (init_noloader) we have to made some memory checks, because 
  we copy blindly into RMGR-memory

  ...

further development:
- merging of task server and RMGR-stage2

- move the interface between fiasco - RMGR-stage2 
  toward the pistacco - roottask interface.
  
  NOW: the RMGR-stage1 is copying the MBI
       directly into the memmory of RMGR-stage2)
  LATER: RMGR-stage2 gets the loaction of the MBI
  	 from the KIP. So there is no direct
	 interaction between RMGR-stage1 and
	 RMGR-stage2 (this also involves some
	 fiasco kernel changes)
