The L4 Root task.

Currently almost identical to the Basic Resource Manager (RMGR).

RMGR is a very old package with functionality more and more replaced by the
L4 environment. Nevertheless, we still depend on some features of that good
old dog. The roottask handles the following resources

- physical memory
- interrupts
- tasks
- small address spaces

Furthermore, the roottask is responsible for starting the basic servers of
the L4 environment, among them the L4 loader.

Note: In your menu.lst load sigma0 first and than roottask.
