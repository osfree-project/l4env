\defgroup grp_pci PCI (wrapper) Module and PCIlib

IO serves PCI requests with it's \e wrapper module and uses an internal
PCIlib extracted from Linux 2.4.x.

For now I don't know where to draw the red line in the PCI subsystem. Linux
drivers make instant use of PCI specific macros/functions. I think many of the
structs has to be kept in io and the driver server... we'll see.

\todo What about more than 1 PCI bus?
\todo UGLY: ##ifdef ... ##endif removed code in Linux .c files

This Module is fully compatible to the Omega0 specification (uses the
