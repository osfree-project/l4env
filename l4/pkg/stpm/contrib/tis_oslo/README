TIS_OSLO
########

TIS_OSLO wraps the TIS driver of OSLO to get a linux
TIS driver for v1.2 TPMs without the need for ACPI or PNP.
It uses probing to figure out whether and which TPM
is available.

As it is based on OSLO code, you need to download OSLO at
http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/~kauer/oslo/ before you can
compile this.
