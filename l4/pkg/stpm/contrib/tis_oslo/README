TIS_OSLO
########

TIS_OSLO wraps the TIS driver of OSLO to get a linux
TIS driver for v1.2 TPMs without the need for ACPI or PNP.
It uses probing to figure out whether and which TPM
is available.

TIS_OSLO 2 is TIS_OSLO and additionally it provides the same
extended Linux TPM interface as other Linux tpm drivers do
(see Linux sources of drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c).

As it is based on OSLO code, you need to download OSLO at
http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/~kauer/oslo/ before you can
compile this.
