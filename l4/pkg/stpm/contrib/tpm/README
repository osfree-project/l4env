Experimental Linux Driver for TPM (TCPA chip) - Driver version 1.1

Changes from 1.0:
  
   - this driver now has an approved device number (c 10 224)
   - this driver now handles suspend/resume correctly
   - compilation against a devfs enabled kernel now works

Building:

    Simply run "make", which should compile a "tpm.o" driver module.

    (Note that we don't a configure script, so you may have to tweak
    the Makefile for systems other than RedHat 8.)

Installing:

    We don't have an automated install, yet. 
    As root, simply copy tpm.o to a reasonable place in /lib/modules:
        cp tpm.o /lib/modules/`uname -r`/misc
    and run depmod to make it available:
        depmod -a
    Then, make the /dev entry:
        mknod /dev/tpm c 10 224

Running:

    /dev/tmp is a character device tha can be read and written.
    This character device accepts/returns bytes in accordance with
    the published TCPA specification, available at
        http://www.trustedcomputing.org
