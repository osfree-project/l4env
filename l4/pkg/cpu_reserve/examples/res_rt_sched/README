This little example demonstrates RT scheduling. It is based on next_res, but
in contrast to this it makes use of the rt_sched bindings.

It sets up 2 timeslices (mandatory and optional). It adapts the length of
the mandatory part and the workload of the optional part by monitoring
itself with the help of preemption ipcs.
