# this shows the effect of the cpu_reserved server. When using the
# reservation server, everything goes well. However, giving "-d" as argument
# to res_rt_sched results in res_rt_sched trying to do the reservations on
# its own, which fails due to an insufficient mcp.
#
# the "cpu -w 2" just prints the status of cpu_reserved every 2 seconds.
