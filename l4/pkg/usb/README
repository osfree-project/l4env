Overview
########

DDEUSB is a  USB driver Framework.  It consists of the DDEUSB server "usbcore"
and its clients. This package contains two sample clients.  First, usbcam a 
USB camera viewer for dope and usbhid a USB human interface device driver, 
which forwards input events to the L4Input  injection proxy.

How-to run it
#############

If everything compiles fine (I hope so...) add the following to your 
menu.lst

  the server:
=================
	module (nd)/tftpboot/path_to/l4v2/usbcore


  for the usbhid example: 
=========================

	module (nd)/tftpboot/path_to/l4v2/usbhid
	
	Furthermore there has to be a application using L4Input 
	(e.g. Dope or L4con).

  for the usbcam example:
=========================

	module (nd)/tftpboot/path_to/l4v2/usbcam

	This application needs DOPE to be running.

	


Porting Linux USB device drivers
################################

Do it  as you would do it for normal other Linux device drivers but link
libddeusb26  to the binary.  This will add a virtual USB host controller to 
the driver, which will talk to the DDEUSB server.
