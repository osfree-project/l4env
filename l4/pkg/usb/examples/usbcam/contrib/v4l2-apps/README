=======================

Linux V4L2 API test/demo applications, utilities and library.

You find a README in each subdirectory explaining what the code there does.

The v4l2 library uses the GNU Lesser General Public License, all other code is
released under the GNU General Public License.

This code is still in its infancy and is not yet suitable for general
use. However, it is a start.
