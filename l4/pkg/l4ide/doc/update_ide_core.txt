In order to update the IDE core it may be neccessary (and is recommended) to
update DDE2.6 and the block driver, too. However, the following changes have to
be made to the files of the IDE core:

in ide-disk.c  there is a printk with %llu as argument near line 1659; this
               isn't supported by our current implementation, so convert this
	       to %lu or implement it

in ide-dma.c   ide_raw_build_sglist isn't ready for our new approach, but it is
               only use by taskfiles - so what
	       ide_build_sglist uses "return pci_map_sg(..." replace this by
	       "return nents;"
	       in the future we should change pci_map_sg to do nothing instead
	       (for ease of maintenance)

in setup-pci.c in ide_pci_enable comment out this device_bars clause - it is
               not implemented by DDE yet plus it is just a second chance
	       mechanism for enableing devices

in ide-probe.c in init_irq put in a piece of code which stores the ID of the
               IRQ handler thread in the drives request queue
	       this way we can share dataspaces with bio_end_io
               the following snippet has to be inserted near line 1082 after:

	               printk(KERN_ERR "ide: failed to init %s\n",drive->name);
	               continue;
	       }

	       ---snip---
	       /* We need to know the ID of our IRQ handler thread */
	       {
	           l4thread_t irq_thread = get_irq_handler_id(HWIF(drive)->irq);
		   if (irq_thread != L4THREAD_INVALID_ID)
		       drive->queue->irq_thread_id = l4thread_l4_id(irq_thread);
		   else
		       drive->queue->irq_thread_id = L4_INVALID_ID;
	       }
	       ---snip---

in ide-io.c    comment out BUG_ON(!irqs_disabled()) because it isn't
               implemented at the moment
