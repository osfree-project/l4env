crt0_nol4env.S:
  (for simple L4 applications without L4env (sigma0, optional OSKit 0.6))
  - initialization of argc/argv
  - falls asleep after main function exited

crt0_l4env.S:
  (for L4env applications (l4env, optional OSKit 1.0))
  - initialization for static constructors
  - calls l4env_startup for L4env initialization
  - use in conjunction with crtn.S to finalize ctors and dtors section!

crt0_l4env_dyn.S:
  (for L4env applications with dynamic libloader/libl4env libraries)
  - application is only startable by L4 loader
  - support for calling constructors/destructors
  - does nothing else because the whole work is done by the L4 loader library
  - use in conjunction with crtn.S to finalize ctors and dtors section!

crt0_oskit10_support.S:
  - for sigma0 applications linked against the OSKit 1.0
  - calls multiboot_main

crtn.S:
  - close .ctors, .dtors, .eh_frame sections

main_stat.ld:
  - linker script for standard L4 applications

main_rel.ld:
  - linker script for Linux kernel modules and XFree86 drivers
  - similar to elf_i386.xr except that we merge all .text.* sections
