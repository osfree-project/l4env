- monotonic counter support
- make quote() actually work
- think about link() ;-)
- implement basic stuff for getting the signing key attested:
  - use TPM_Quote() to get Lyon own TCB attested
  - do one of the following:
    - get a TTP to sign the public key after Lyon being remotely attested
    - use DAA to attest that the signature (created by the TPM) of the
      signing key has been created by a valid TPM (this means we also need
      to send the measurements of Lyon's TCB whenever Lyon creates a
      signature
- use more secure algorithms for making signatures (-> modify/extend
  libcrypto)
- refactoring:
  - avoid L4 stuff (L4_EPERM, ...)
  - move the lyon core stuff into a lib
