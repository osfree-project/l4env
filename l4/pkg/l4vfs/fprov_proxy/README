'fprov_proxy' is a small program which implements the 'generic_fprov'
interface. It uses the posix functions (open,read,close)
provided by the libc and the 'l4vfs' to access/provide files.

The intention of the server is to provide a simple wrapper to use
'generic_fprov' programs, mainly the 'loader', with 'l4vfs' fileservers,
for example the 'simple_file_server'. 

usage : "loader -fprov=fprov_proxy_fs"
