=== Bug reported by Aaron Pohle ===

Description:
------------
  When mmap()'ing a file from a L4VFS file server, the corresponding region is
  no longer available for reallocation after executing munmap().

  Example triggering the bug in main.c

Fix
---
  L4VFS' munmap_normal() implementation did only run munmap remotely at the
  file server, but did not detach the corresponding region properly.
