The simple_file_server is an example for a simple server implementing
the L4VFS interface.  It supports both, files linked directly to it
via 'server/files.lst' and files given as startup argument via grub.

Currently the simple_file_server has limited write access (no new file
creation; existing files may not grow) and a flat file structure (no
directories below the root directory are supported).

For an example usage look at the script
'drops/tools/runux/term_con_test'.
