This server provides simply output channels in l4vfs manner, which are
forwarded to log.  As such it wraps log's output features, but
provides its functionality trough a simple open()/write()/close()
interface.

On startup the servers provides just a empty directory in the l4vfs
name space.  Files are created dynamically if they are resolved, that
is, each program can direct its output to another channel.

A typical use case would be to use the --stdout and --stderr
parameter, which are interpreted by the io-backend to open up fd 1 and
2 on this server.

Example usage:

  ./fiasco -lname_server -l"fstab -c /server -c /server/log -v10 -b/   \
      -m/server/log" -ll4vfs_log -l"my_prog1 --stdout                  \
      /server/log/my_prog_channel"
