Lots of stuff ...

 * real docu
 * Impl. a file server, which provides the filesystem of a running L4Linux
 * Servers need to have more internal parallelism, maybe using DICE's
   [allow_reply_only]
 * generalize error codes
 * ...
 * select misbehavior
 ** enqueing for packets and checking consume some time
 ** If timeout is to small and/or high priority threads running, it can happen
 ** that notify thread of select doesn't manage to get info to thread calling select.
 ** Phenomen: There seems to be no packets received, however they are.
 ** Currently workaround (no fix!): add warning wenn timeout is small in select.c
