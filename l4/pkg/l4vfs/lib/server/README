This library collection implements many dummy functions necessary to
run a l4vfs server.  I noticed that many l4vfs servers do not need all
functions, if you do not want to reinvent the (dummy) wheel, just link
one of these libs.

Please note, that all functions in these libs are 'weak', that is, you
can replace functionality from this lib peace by peace in your own
server.
