L4VFS is a collection of interfaces, servers, and client and server
libraries.  The name L4VFS is an abbreviation of "L4 virtual file
system".  It is built around a name_server, which helps when dealing
with multiple objects in a hierarchical namespace.


L4VFS can be used to more easily port posix applications to L4, as the
client libs provide posix-like functions, that is, the client libs act
as an libc backend.

Please also look into the documentation in 'l4/pkg/l4vfs/doc' and in
'l4/pkg/uclibc/'.


FAQ
===

* I think something is wrong with open(), create(), etc.  Files are
  opened with wrong access modi or not at all.  What gives?

  In case you are using a mixed setup of oskit-libc/dietlibc/uclibc servers
  and clients please make sure you do use the same definition of
  constants like (O_RDONLY, ...) or you must provide a wrapper
  (oskit defines O_RDONLY to 1, nearly all other libcs to 0).

* I'm starting my programs with the loader and they simply don't
  startup. Why?

  [Old] The problem is, that the name_server must by started via RMGR,
  as its client-lib uses RMGR functions to get the task_id.  Don't
  start the name_server with loader.

  [New] The client-lib now uses 'names' for finding the 'name_server'.
  You should not have unusual problems.
