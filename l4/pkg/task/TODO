* Callbacks:
  * provide callbacks so that a server can interface the server lib and implement
    its own handling of client requests (e.g., L4Linux can implement task caching
	this way and one might implement task allocation policies with it).
* X0 - cannot use l4_task_new(). Tasks always need to be created by roottask, so
  provide create/kill interface, too.
