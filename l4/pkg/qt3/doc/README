This directory contains some documentation on how to start Qt3 applications in
L4/DROPS. If you are looking for the Qt API & tools documentation, please use
the online version on Trolltech's web site or the packaged version from your
Linux distribution. Also see $L4DIR/pkg/qt3/lib/contrib/README regarding this
subject.

0) Some background
------------------

Qt/Embedded ships with its own windowing system, which also includes a variety
of prerendered fonts (.qpf files in $QTDIR/lib/fonts). You have to make these
font files available via L4VFS before you can start any Qt3 application. In
this directory you will find a 'loader' config file (cfg_qt3_file_servers),
which I used for the TUD:OS Demo CD. It will start three instances of
'simple_file_server' and one instance of 'tmpfs'. It also uses 'fstab' to
create the following directory hierarchy in L4VFS:

/
+-qt3
| +-lib
|   +-fonts
+-data
+-sheep
+-tmp

/qt3/lib/fonts contains a set of .qpf font files, in /data you will find some
pictures and text files, and /sheep contains all files necessary for the game
'Little Sheep'. The 'tmpfs' file server allows you store files in /tmp (e.g.,
modified text files saved with QTinyEditor). The data files (data + sheep) are
in $L4DIR/pkg/qt3/examples/data. You can copy/symlink this directory to your
tftpboot boot directory.

You will need to adapt the path variables at the beginning of the loader
script. Another config file (cfg_qrun) can be used to start the Qt application
launcher QRun. Also, you must pass the '-qws' switch to exactly _one_ of the
Qt applications in a session. This application will then become the QWS server
(cfg_qrun does this for you).


1) Starting a Qt session in Fiasco/UX:
--------------------------------------

You can start a Qt3 session with Fiasco/UX and fuxfprov. Just have a look at
the following two files:

  $L4DIR/tool/runux/qt3_loader
and
  $L4DIR/pkg/qt3/examples/qrun/run.sh

You may need to adapt the $CFGPATH variable in

$L4DIR/tool/runux/config.local


2) GRUB menu.lst for native Fiasco:
-----------------------------------

Finally, the file menu.lst in this directory contains a sample GRUB menu.lst
for launching Qt3 applications. Again, you will need to adapt the path
variables.
