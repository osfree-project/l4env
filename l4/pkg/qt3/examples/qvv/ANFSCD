  Few random notes...

  QVV is one of the first apps that did provide me the software support I 
needed when I moved permanently to Linux. Actually I wrote it few days after I
made the OS switch decision. It took me about 2 hours reading Qt manual and 
coding to produce the first version. QVV didn't change much since this first 
version, actually even the first one has all the features I wanted from a small 
quick and easy image browser and viewer. Most probably QVV will keep the 
original look and feel and in the future and I don't have some real plans for 
new features etc. It works just perfect for me and I hope it will do it for 
you too :) In any case this application is and will be one of the few main 
tools I do use all the time.
  
  Question: What is this file for (really)?? Uhm, well, I just wanted to write
a paragraph about QVV. It was amazing how fast I did it which is because of the
great Qt toolkit (this is *not* ad, this is the truth:)) and how amazingly
usefull and handy QVV appears (for me at least).
  
  What `ANFSCD' stands for? It is abbreviation for `And Now For Something
Completely Different'. First -- I'm *not* Monthy Python (spell ok?) fan and
second this *isn't* really for something completely different. I just didn't
know how to name this file :)

  Thanx for the attention!
