ENVIRONMENT CONFIG

    QVV_REDUCE_HEIGHT         -- this will reduce actual desktop height by
                                 given number of pixels (used mainly if you have
                                 some kind of `task bar', `panel' or something )
    
    QVV_FILTERS               -- filters for image files in this format:
                                 .ext1.ext2.ext3.
                                 example:
    
    QVV_NOAQUA                -- if set QVV will not try to mimic Aqua-like
                                 interface (colors) style
    
    export QVV_FILTERS=.jpg.jpeg.gif.png.xpm.bmp.ppm.
    (for bash)
