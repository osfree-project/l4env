This is a slightly modified example program from the
qt-embedded-free-3.3.3.tar.bz2 tarball. You can find it in the
examples/application subdirectory.

It is a small text editor, useful to debug keyboard support and
file/directory stuff.

The only modification (apart from renaming the files from *.cpp to
*.cc) is, that I disabled the printer stuff, because it is not supported
by the library at the moment.
