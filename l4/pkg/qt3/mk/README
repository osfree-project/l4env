'qt3.mk' provides all the magic needed to build Qt applications in
DROPS, including support for 'moc' and 'uic'. 

ATTENTION: Qt applications will be linked against both buddy_slab_mem
and simple_mem backends.


All Makefiles for Qt applications should include this file before

  $(L4DIR)/mk/prog.mk or
  $(L4DIR)/mk/lib.mk. 


The folling additional 'make' variables are available:

SRC_MOC
        Contains all .h files, that need to be processed by
        'moc'.

SRC_UI
        Contains all .ui files to be fed into 'uic'.

SRC_UI_IMG
        Contains all image files, that should be embedded into the
        resulting binary.

QT3_IO_BACKEND
        Set to one of the following :
          'con':  use l4con driver (works also with proxygon)
          'dope': use DOpE driver
          'sdl':  use VESA framebuffer driver
        Only the 'con' driver provides support for multiple Qt/E
        processes on one desktop.

DEBUG_LIBQT3
        Set to '1', if you want to link against a version of
        libqt3_embedded.a, which has debugging symbols. This will
        increase link times, however.
