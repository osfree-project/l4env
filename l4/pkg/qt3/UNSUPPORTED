The L4 port of Qt3 is currently unmaintained. It may or may not work for you.
We provide it as is and do _NOT_ provide any support.


Nevertheless, this is what should work if you built Qt3/L4 with _dietlibc_:

* The GUI framework is supposed to work with the l4con I/O back end (you may
  also use 'proxygon', if you want to run Qt3 with DOpE). There is also
  Makefile support for Qt Designer (*.ui files, images).
* File I/O works partially, largely depending on the L4VFS file servers you
  use. Listing directory contents will be broken, if you built with ucLibc
  instead of dietlibc.
* Network support is broken.
* Process control, shared libraries, and sound are not supported by the
  library. Other functionality not listed here is untested and may not work.

The following packages/modules from the remote CVS of the TU Dresden Operating
system group are required:

 - dietlibc (Qt3 also compiles with uclibc, but file I/O will be broken then)
 - L4VFS
 - local_socks
 - l4con or proxygon
 - rtc
 - semaphore
 - dm_phys
 - cxx*
 - ...
