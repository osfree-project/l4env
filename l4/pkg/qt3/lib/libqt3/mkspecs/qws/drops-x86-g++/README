For DROPS we do not provide the final 'qmake.conf' here. Instead
we generate it during the build process from 'qmake.conf.template'
to specify the appropriate compiler binaries and #include paths from
the L4 build environment. 

See the $L4DIR/pkg/qt3/lib/libqt3/Makefile and
$L4DIR/pkg/qt3/lib/libqt3/scripts/make-qmake-conf.sh for details.
