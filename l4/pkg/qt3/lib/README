Brief description of the subdirs:
---------------------------------

contrib:   original, unmodified Qt/Embedded source (some parts
           missing, see contrib/README)

libqt3:    build dir for Qt/Embedded, contains modified versions
           of files from contrib (see contrib/README for details)

backends:  class replacements and other stuff relevant for DROPS
           port, these require L4-stuff and are built as seperate
	   libraries using BID
	   
drivers:   same as backends, but it contains just graphics and input
           drivers for Qt/Embedded for DROPS
	   
L4-specific headers will be installed to l4/qt3/, the original Qt/Embedded
headers will be installed in qt3/ (referring to $L4DIR/include/, here).
