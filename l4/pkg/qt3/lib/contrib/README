What is here?
-------------
The directory 'qt-embedded-free' contains parts of the Qt/Embedded source
distribution. Some directories, e.g. examples and tutorials, were not
included in L4 CVS, because of there size. You can download the original
source archive from http://www.trolltech.com/, if you want to have a look
at those missing things.
Also note, that tools like Qt Designer are not built here. Instead it is
recommended, that you use the ones from your Linux distribution (same for
the Qt-API documentation).
You can download the source from Trolltech as mentioned above. Debian
users can apt-get the tools:

  apt-get update
  apt-get install qt3-doc qt3-dev-tools qt3-designer


For building Qt/Embedded on DROPS, all unmodified files are linked to
../libqt3/. Some links, which were in the original tarball but could not
be included in CVS, are recreated there, too. This will happen
automatically, when you run 'make' for the first time.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------
You should not modify any files here. Instead you should copy the file you
wish to change into the corresponding directory in ../libqt3/, as this is
the place, where building is done. You may need to delete the link in
../libqt3/ before.
