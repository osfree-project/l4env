What is this?
-------------

This is Qt/Embedded for DROPS. The port is still work in progress,
basic functionality is already there, however. 


Requirements:
-------------

The following L4Env components are required:

- Fiasco/Fiasco-UX
- log
- dm_phys
- names
- name_server
- L4VFS file server (e.g. simple_file_server)
- fstab (for mounting the file server's filesystem)
- rtc
- con (or dope)
- local_socks
- thread
- semaphore
- zlib

You might want to have a look at $L4DIR/tool/runux/qt3_app_{con|dope} and
there are also application specific 'run.sh' scripts in pkg/qt3/examples/*.
These scripts can be used to start the examples in Fiasco-UX.

Additionally you may need some of the tools provides by Trolltech,
namely 'moc' and 'uic'. If you want to use Qt-Designer for GUI modeling
or Qt-Linguist for internationalization, you need to install those as
well. Debian users just need to apt-get them:

  apt-get update
  apt-get install qt3-dev-tools qt3-designer qt3-linguist
