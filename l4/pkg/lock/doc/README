This directory contains the sources for the L4 Lock Library documentation. 

To create the documentation, run 'doxygen doxygen-refman.cfg' and 
'doxygen doxygen-internal.cfg', this will create the directories 
refman and internal.

There are two different documentations:

- 'L4 Lock Reference Manual' (refman/html/index.html)
  Information about how to use the Lock Library.

- 'L4 Lock Source Code Documentation (internal/html/index.html)
  Implementation docs.
