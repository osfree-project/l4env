This coordinator 'l4vfs_coord' does not provide simple lists with all
available dataspaces as 'coord' does, but organizes his dataspaces in
a hierarchical namespace accessible via l4vfs.

The interface to the monitored programs is exactly the same as the one
'coord' uses, such that both server can be used interchangeably.
