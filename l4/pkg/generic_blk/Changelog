0.3 - Lars, 03/16/2001
- Added done-callback function to the client library. There are now two ways
  to wait for requests to be finished, specifying a semaphore or a callback 
  function. The callback function is executed by the notification thread of
  the blk-client-library, therefore clients may need to implement their own
  synchronization scheme.

0.1 - Lars, 02/12/2001 (untagged)
