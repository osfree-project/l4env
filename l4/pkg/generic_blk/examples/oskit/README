blk_oskit is an example implementation of the generic_blk interface. It uses
the OSKit linux device drvers.

Usage:
module = (nd)/boot/blk_oskit [-i|--ide] [-s|--scsi=<driver>] [-d|--device=<device>] [-w|--write]
  -i|--ide               use IDE driver
  -s|--scsi=<driver>     use SCSI driver <driver>, currently ncrc8xx and
                         buslogic are supported
  -d|--device=<device>   open device <device>, devices are specified by
                         Linux names, e.g. hda1 for the fist partition of 
                         an IDE drive
  -w|--write             open device writeable, default is to open a device
                         read-only
