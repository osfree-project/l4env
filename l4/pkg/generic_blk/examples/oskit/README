blk_oskit is an example implementation of the generic_blk interface. It uses
the OSKit linux device drvers.

Usage:

module = blk_oskit [-i|--ide] [-s|--scsi=<driver>] [-d|--device=<device>] [-w|--write] [--sleep=<time>]

  -i|--ide               use IDE driver
  -s|--scsi=<driver>     use SCSI driver <driver>, currently ncrc8xx and
                         buslogic are supported
  -d|--device=<device>   open device <device>, devices are specified by
                         Linux names, e.g. hda1 for the fist partition of 
                         an IDE drive
  -w|--write             open device writeable, default is to open a device
                         read-only
  --sleep=<time>         sleep for <time> ms before initializing the driver.
                         This is sometimes necessary to give other drivers 
                         the chance to allocate their interrupts. The oskit 
                         drivers do autoprobing of interrupts, i.e. requesting 
                         all available interrupts at omega0/l4io. This
                         confuses other drivers.

Example:

  module = blk_oskit --ide --device=hda1 --sleep=2000

  This waits for 2s, starts the ide driver and opens the device 'hda1'
  read-only.
