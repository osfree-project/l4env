Lots of stuff ...

 * we need more and better backends
    - memory management backend for no-l4env
    - real-time capable memory management (e.g. TLSF)
 * the amount of c-files in the port should be increased (this must
   probably be backed by more / better backends)
 * network functionality, maybe via "flips"?
   - <in progress>
   - My idea to somewhat unify the interfaces for network-io and
     file-io (open - socket, read - recv, write - send, close -
     shutdown) was found to be tempting but not easy to be realized.
     Additionally, these unified interfaced should never be the only
     access to the backends, as to provide backward compatibility and
     a base to port programs.  So, the design and implementation of
     these unified interfaces can be arbitrarily deferred.
 * real docu
 * shared lib support
 * adaption of libpthread to l4threads
 * care for/check threadsafeness
 * ...
