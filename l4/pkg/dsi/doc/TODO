Documentation:
- write doc/dsi.txt

- On connect, check for compatibility of streams (mapped vs. static).

- Doku: Are the control/data-areas mapped after socket creation? Document
  this!

Naming scheme:
- A client referencing a sender ends up using constructs like
  "sender.socket.socket" to get the socket-id of the sender-sockref. It is
  absolutely unintuitive, because it is a socket-reference and nobody gets
  the message what 'socket.socket' could be. Probably, dsi_component_t
  contains a field named sockref instead of socket.
- we have dsi_jcp_stream_t and dsi_stream_cfg_t, both are configuration
  structures

Dataspaces:
- replace map area management in dataspace.c with map area allocation 
  in libdrm

Threads:
- rewrite thread.c if thread library is available

Synchronization:
- currently we don't support multiple work threads using the same socket 
  (get/commit_packet don't do any synchronization on that)
