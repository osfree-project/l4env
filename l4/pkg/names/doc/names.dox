\mainpage names - DROPS Name Service

\section desc Description

Names is a simple name service for DROPS. It provides a mapping of names
(strings) to L4 <code>thread_id</code>s and vice versa.

\section features Features

Names implements the following primitives:
- register a name with a thread_id
- unregister name
- unregister all names registered for a certain task
- query thread_id of a name
- query name of a thread_id
- query all registered thread_id's

Names enforces a string being registered at most once at a certain time.

\section limit Limitations

The number of names that can be registered is ::NAMES_MAX_ENTRIES, the
maximum name length is ::NAMES_MAX_NAME_LEN. These values are defined in
libnames.h.

Security is currently not a big thing in names. A thread can register a name
for an arbitrary thread_id - and unregister it as well.

\section usage Usage

The DROPS Name Service is implemented as an L4 server. Currently it has only
one command line option:

\par -verbose &lt;verbosity&gt;
If %lt;verbosity%gt; is 1 all register and unregister requests are logged.
With %lt;verbosity%gt; set to 2 also all query requests are logged.

The library \ref clientapi provides a convenient way to access
the DROPS Name Service through a set of C function calls.
