=== Bug reported by Andre Puschmann ===

main.c contains Linux kernel code that triggers 2 problems:

1) list order violation in the list alloc lib
2) threads hang after scheduling a very short timer, because
   the timer thread seems to miss some events


Fixes
=====
1) correct locking for ddekit's memory allocation functions
   solves the problem
2) fixed DDEKit's timer implementation to not use IPC for
   notifications (because some got lost for atomicity reasons)
   but use a counting semaphore
