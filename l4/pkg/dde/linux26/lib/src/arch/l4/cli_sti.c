/**
 * DDE local IRQ handling
 *
 * Linux allows CPUs to locally disable and enable interrupts, e.g.
 * by setting the IF flag in X86' EFLAGS. In DDE, we can't allow to
 * do this globally, because we don't want our driver to influence
 * independent L4 tasks.
 *
 * Instead, we could simply leave the routines below empty, because
 * each DDE thread is a separate "virtual" CPU and therefore cannot
 * be interrupted. Global variables are secured by spinlocks, which
 * also work without IRQs disabled. However, DDE threads might run
 * in different priorities which could lead to a priority inversion
 * situation, where a high-prio thread spins on a spinlock held by
 * a low-prio thread. Therefore, we use a DDEKit lock to ensure that
 * all VCPUs that try to switch off IRQs locally are serialized.
 *
 * In addition to the lock, we need to keep track of the number of
 * times irq_disable() has been called. This is because it is quite
 * common for Linux drivers to call this multiple times in a row and
 * then only call irqs_enable() once. In our case we then need to
 * release the lock as many times as we acquired it, because the
 * underlying L4 lock implementation implements recursive locking.
 *
 * Furthermore, we need to be able to check whether IRQs are on or
 * off. Linux does this by having a look at the IF flag. In our case,
 * we return the current reference count during save_flags() and use
 * this value to restore the current state later on.
