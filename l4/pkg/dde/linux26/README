  This is DDELinux 2.6

Directory structure
###################

'contrib/'
==========

This directory tree holds unmodified Linux sources. The files residing here are
sourced by Makefiles in 'examples' and 'lib'. All unmodified C headers are also
kept here.


'examples/'
==========

Here reside test code and example drivers.


'include/'
==========

Currently reimplemented and modified C headers as well as the DDELinux 2.6 API
definition are kept in this directory tree.


'lib/src/<linux subdir name>'
=============================

When taking a function from Linux, the complete Linux file it belongs to is
copied to 'lib/src/<linux subdir name>' if only parts of the file are used by
DDELinux and others are commented out ('#ifndef DDE_LINUX...#endif').


'lib/src/arch/l4'
=================

Implementations that map Linux functions to DDEKit reside here. This code does
_not_ contain any Linux code, but only reimplements some functions
