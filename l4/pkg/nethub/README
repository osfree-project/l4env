This package contains not really a network HUB but a component that
implements a set of cross-link cables.

This component can be used to connect two instances of L4Linux via xl4tun
devices. This is the first step towards the l4-ipsec implementation that
shall be implemented in such a cross-link cable. 

At the moment the component is not optimized and uses long IPC for
transfering network packets. The final version shall use memory mappings to
do a singe decryption/encryption-and-copy step.
