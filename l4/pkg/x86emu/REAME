This is an emulator for 16-bit x86 code. The project x86emu was written by
SciTech (http://www.scitechsoft.com) and is under a BSD style license, 
comaptible with the XFree86 and X licenses used by XFree86 (see license
at lib/src/LICENSE). This library is used by XFree86 4.xx to emulate x86
BIOS calls on operating systems which do not support the vm86 mode.

There is a L4Linux kernel module which offers functionality to emulate
the sys_vm86old() system call which is used by XFree86. In L4Linux, we
have to ensure that we have access to the whole 1MB address space which
was set up by the Linux program which want to execute some code using the
vm86 mode. The end of the code is marked by the "HLT" instruction which
is privileged and therefore stops the emulator.
