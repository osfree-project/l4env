Simple file provider using the TFTP protocol.

This package implements the file provider interface as defined by the
generic_fprov package (see documentation of that package for details).
The network stuff was taken from GRUB. Currently we support DEC Tulip,
VMware pcnet32, 3COM 3c595, 3COM 3x90x, 3COM 3x509, NE2000, Realtek 8139m,
Intel EEPro 100 and the OshKosh network package. Implementing additional
drivers should be very easy.
