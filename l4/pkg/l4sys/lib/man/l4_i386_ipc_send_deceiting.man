.SH " Description"
A chief can specify a virtual sender id in \fIids\fP which the
recipient should get instead of the chief's id. Recall that deceiting
is secure since only direction\-preserving deceit is possible. If the
specified virtual sender id does not fulfill this constraint, the call
works like \fBl4_i386_ipc_send()\fP.
.SH " Arguments"
.IP "\fIids\fP"
Structure containg true and virtual sender id. 
.IP "\fI*snd_msg\fP"
Pointer to a Send Descriptor. It can contain the 
following values:
.RS
.IP "<mem>"
Ipc includes sending a message to the destination 
specified by \fIdest\fP. \fI*snd_msg\fP must point to a valid
message. The first two 32\-bit words of the message have to be given 
separately in \fIsnd_dword0\fP and \fIsnd_dword1\fP.
.IP "\fB0\fP"
Ipc includes sending a message to the destination specified by\fIdest\fP. The message consists solely of the two 32\-bit words \fIsnd_dword0\fP and \fIsnd_dword1\fP. 
.RE
.IP "\fIsnd_dword0\fP"
The first dword to be transmitted.
.IP "\fIsnd_dword1\fP"
The second dword to be transmitted.
.IP "\fItimeout\fP"
This 32\-bit word specifies all 4 timouts, the
quadruple (snd, rcv, snd pf, rcv pf). For a detailed description see
the L4 Reference Manual.
.IP "\fIresult\fP"
The message dope describing the result of the Ipc.
.SH "Return Values"
The following return values are possible:
.IP "\fB0\fP"
No error occured. The optional send operation was
successful, and if a receive operation was also specified, a message
was also received correctly. 
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_ENOT_EXISTENT\fP"
Non\-existing destination or source.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_RETIMEOUT\fP"
Timeout during receive operation.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_SETIMEOUT\fP"
Timeout during send operation.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_RECANCELED\fP"
Receive operation cancelled by another thread.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_SECANCELED\fP"
Send operation cancelled by another thread.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_REMAPFAILED\fP"
Map failed due to a shortage of page
tables during receive operation.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_SEMAPFAILED\fP"
Map failed due to a shortage of page
tables during send operation.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_RESNDPFTO\fP"
Send pagefault timeout.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_SERCVPFTO\fP"
Receive pagefault timeout.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_REABORTED\fP"
Receive operation aborted by another
thread.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_SEABORTED\fP"
Send operation aborted by another thread.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_REMSGCUT\fP"
Received message cut. Potential reasons
are:
.RS
.IP "(a)"
The recipient's mword buffer is too small.
.IP "(b)"
The recipient does not accept enough strings.
.IP "(c)"
At least one of the recipient's string buffers is too small.
