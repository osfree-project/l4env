<sect> Description

The <code/l4_task_new()/ system call deletes and/or creates a task. Deletion
of a task means that the address space of the task and all threads of
the task disappear. The cpu time of all deleted threads is added to
the cputime of the deleting thread. If the deleted task was chief of a
clan, all tasks of the clan are deleted as well.

Tasks may be created as active or inactive. For an active task, a new
address space is created together with 128 threads. Lthread 0 is
started, the other ones wait for a "real" creation using 
<code/l4_thread_ex_regs()/. An inactive task is empty. It occupies no
resources, has no address space and no threads. Communication with
inactive tasks is not possible.

A newly created task gets the creator as its chief, i.e. it is created
inside the creator's clan. Symmetrically, a task can only be deleted
either directly by its chief or indirectly by a higher-level chief.

<sect>Arguments

<desc

<dt/<var/dest// Task id of an existing task whose chief is the
current task. If this is not fulfilled, the system call has no effect. 
Simultaneously, a new task with the same task number is created. It
may be active or inactive.

<dt/<var/mcp_or_new_chief// Depending on the state of the task (active or
inactive), two variants are possible here: 

<desc

<dt/&lt;mcp>/
Maximum controlled priority defines the highest priority which can be
ruled by the new task acting as a scheduler. The new task's effective
mcp is the minimum of the creator's mcp and the specified mcp.
Use this parameter if the newly generated task is an active task.

<dt/&lt;new_chief>/ Specifies the chief of the new inactive task. This
mechanism permits to transfer inactive tasks to other
tasks. Transferring an inactive task to the specified chief means to
transfer the related right to create a task.
Use this parameter if the newly generated task is an inactive task.

</desc>

<dt/<var/esp// Initial stack pointer for lthread 0 if the new task is
created as an active one. Ignore otherwise.

<dt/<var/eip// Initial instruction pointer for lthread 0 if the new task is
created as an active one. Ignored otherwise.

<dt/<var/pager// If <code/L4_NIL_ID/ is used, the new task is created as
inactive. Lthread 0 is not created. Otherwise the new task is created
as active and the specified pager is associated to Lthread 0.  

<sect>Return Values 

If task creation succeeded its id is delivered
back. If the new task is active, the new task id will have a new
version number so that it differs from all task ids used
earlier. Chief and task number are the same as in dest task. If the
new task is created inactive, the chief is taken from the chief
parameter; the task number remains unchanged. The version is undefined
so that the new task id might be identical with a formerly (but not
currently and not in future) valid task id. This is safe since
communication with inactive tasks is impossible.

If task creation failed  <code/L4_NIL_ID/ is returned.
