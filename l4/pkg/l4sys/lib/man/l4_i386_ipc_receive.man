.SH " Description"
This operation includes no send phase. The invoker waits for a message
from \fIsrc\fP. Messages from other sources are not accepted. Note
that also a hardware interrupt might be specified as source.
.SH " Arguments"
.IP "\fIsrc\fP"
Thread id of the source.
.IP "\fI*rcv_msg\fP"
Pointer to Receive Descriptor. It can contain the
following values: 
.RS
.IP "\fB0\fP"
Only messages up to two 32\-bit words and are
accepted. The received message is returned in \fIrcv_dword0\fP and\fIrcv_dword1\fP. 
.IP "<mem>"
If Bit 1 of \fI*rcv_msg\fP is 0 ipc includes receiving a
message respectively waiting to receive a message. \fI*rcv_msg\fP must
point to a valid message. Note that the first two 32\-bit words of the 
received message are returned in \fIrcv_dword0\fP and \fIrcv_dword1\fP.
.IP "<rmap>"
If Bit 1 of \fI*rcv_msg\fP is 1 only send\-fpage
messages or up to two 32\-bit words (in \fIrcv_dword0\fP and\fIrcv_dword1\fP) are accepted. If a map message is received, the 30
most significant bits describe the receive fpage (instead of\fIrcvfpage option\fP in a memory message buffer). Thus fpages can
also be received without a message buffer in memory. 
.RE
.IP "\fI*rcv_dword0\fP"
First of two 32\-bit words of received message,
undefined if no message was received. 
.IP "\fI*rcv_dword1\fP"
Second of two 32\-bit words of received message,
undefined if no message was received. 
.IP "\fItimeout\fP"
This 32\-bit word specifies all 4 timouts, the
quadruple (snd, rcv, snd pf, rcv pf). For a detailed description see
the L4 Reference Manual.
.IP "\fIresult\fP"
The message dope describing the result of the Ipc.
.SH "Return Values"
The following return values are possible:
.IP "\fB0\fP"
No error occured. The optional send operation was
successful, and if a receive operation was also specified, a message
was also received correctly. 
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_ENOT_EXISTENT\fP"
Non\-existing destination or source.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_RETIMEOUT\fP"
Timeout during receive operation.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_SETIMEOUT\fP"
Timeout during send operation.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_RECANCELED\fP"
Receive operation cancelled by another thread.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_SECANCELED\fP"
Send operation cancelled by another thread.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_REMAPFAILED\fP"
Map failed due to a shortage of page
tables during receive operation.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_SEMAPFAILED\fP"
Map failed due to a shortage of page
tables during send operation.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_RESNDPFTO\fP"
Send pagefault timeout.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_SERCVPFTO\fP"
Receive pagefault timeout.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_REABORTED\fP"
Receive operation aborted by another
thread.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_SEABORTED\fP"
Send operation aborted by another thread.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_REMSGCUT\fP"
Received message cut. Potential reasons
are:
.RS
.IP "(a)"
The recipient's mword buffer is too small.
.IP "(b)"
The recipient does not accept enough strings.
.IP "(c)"
At least one of the recipient's string buffers is too small.
