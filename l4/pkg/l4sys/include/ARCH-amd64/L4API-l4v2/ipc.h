 *                       undefined if no message was received.

 *            -# The recipient does not accept enough strings.
 *            -# At least one of the recipient's string buffers is too small.
 *
 * \a snd_msg is sent to thread with id \a dest and the invoker waits for a
 * reply from this thread. Messages from other sources are not accepted.
 * Note that since the send/receive transition needs no time, the destination
 * can reply with send timeout 0.
 *
 * This operation can also be used for a server with one dedicated client. It
 * sends the reply to the client and waits for the client's next order.
