                       ============= todo list =============

- fastforward
- docu, comment code
- debug and use libavformat
- tests ...
- rewrite for recording support:
  - rewrite muxer
  - rewrite import-plugins
  - build GUI for recording (vcontrol)
  - support USB-Webcam again
- soundcard (Vsync & oss-plugins): develop & use soundserver
- make types non-32bit save (portable?)
- fix compiler warnings
- of course: fix known bugs
- fix all TODO's and FIXME's in source code
- more gerneric interface to embed plugins into verner



                      ============= known BUGS =============


- Some libs aren't compiled by L4-make system. This can cause compiler
  problems, for instance, when using gcc-3.x as system compiler and 
  gcc-2.x for L4.
- vcontrol: seeking will fail, if (audio xor video) is EOF (in vdemuxer), but vcore 
  still decodes some buffered bytes. This happens very near the end of the video



                      ============= limitations =============

for all components:
- currently only x86-IA32 is supported

vdemuxer:
- works only file based (unix std calls)
  (have a look at include/drops-compat.h and at docs/plugins/)

vsync:
- audio is only availiable for ES1371 cards (vsync-es1371) (some SB16-PCI's),
  i810-compatible (vsync-i810) and  VIA 82cxxx-based cards (vsync-via) .
  You'll have to change Vsync (Makefile+contrib) to use it with other
  ported sound drivers - see also dde_linux/examples/sound.
- syncronization is only availiable for OSS-Drivers (Open Sound System) without(!)
  bug in ioctl(SNDCTL_DSP_GETOPTR)
