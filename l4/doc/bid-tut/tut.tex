\title{Building Infrastructure for DROPS (BID) Tutorial}
\author{Jork Löser \qquad Ronald Aigner\\l4-hackers@os.inf.tu-dresden.de}
\date{\today}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  BID is a collection of conventions and files that help in the build
  (compile) process of applications for DROPS. Among the features are:
  compiler and linker selection, automatically generated rules for
  linking a binary and archiving a library, dependency generation,
  installation, documentation compilation.

  BID ensures a defined behavior of packages that is needed for the
  automatic building process of the project.

  This document describes how to write a package.
\end{abstract}

\html{This document is also available as \htmladdnormallink{.ps}{tut.ps}
  and \htmladdnormallink{.pdf}{tut.pdf} file.}

\section{Assumptions}
\label{sec:assumptions}

This tutorial is to help the reader (you) to write applications using
BID. We assume you to know the basic Unix commands and concepts of its
file system. For understanding the example programs, you should be
familiar with C.

Compiling packages for DROPS requires a specific compilation
environment to be set up. This environment contains IDL compilers,
special versions of a standard C library, various Linux kernel
sources, compiled DROPS packages and others. A tutorial on how to set
up this environment can be found in \cite{drops:building}. We assume
the environment being set up correctly.

We assume that you checked out the L4Env \cite{www:l4env} module from the
DROPS download page \cite{drops:download} and build the environment.  To test
your package, you will also need the Fiasco module. If you are at the
Operating Systems Group here at TU Dresden with access to the file server
\name{os.inf.tu-dresden.de}, most of these files are installed at /home/drops.

\section{Finding around}

Lets assume your base directory where your DROPS-sources are is
«§(HOME)/src». After checking out the files using CVS, you end up with
a couple of directories:

\begin{descriptiontable}{xxxxxxxxxx}
  l4/           & the L4 directory, later referenced as §(L4DIR). \\
  l4linux-2.6/  & L4Linux 2.6 \\
\end{descriptiontable}

There might be others as well, likely Linux kernels, which are needed
by some DROPS packages. Within the L4 directory, you will find

\begin{descriptiontable}{l4/include}
  l4/kernel     & sources of L4 micro kernel implementations, primarily FIASCO. \\
  l4/pkg        & base directory of all DROPS packages. \\
  l4/tool       & tools for compilation, among them the IDL compiler
                  DICE.\\
  l4/mk         & BID macros to control compilation and installation.
                  \\
  l4/doc        & base directory for documentation, will also contain
                  compiled packet documentation later. \\
  l4/include    & base directory for include files exported by
                  packages. \\
  l4/lib        & base directory for compiled libraries. \\
  l4/bin        & base directory for compiled binaries (might be a
                  symbolic link). \\
\end{descriptiontable}


\section{Your first hello world}
\label{sec:first.hello}

As DROPS is a multi-server system, programs are seen as servers,
offering some services to other programs. Our infrastructure reflects
this by using packages for managing different programs. A package
typically contains a server, libraries and include files to be exported.

Your first hello world program does not offer any service to clients,
nonetheless we say it is a server (without any clients, though). Let's
name it hiworld. You create the package by creating a directory called
«hiworld» in «l4/pkg»:

|~/src/l4/pkg> mkdir hiworld|

This directory is called \emph{package dir} and will be referenced as
«§(PKGDIR)». Switch to the directory and use the template provided by
BID to create the basic directory structure together with some
Makefiles:

|~/src/l4/pkg/hiworld> ../../mk/tmpl/inst|

This results in a couple of directories and a makefile to be created. 
The makefile is ready to use and builds your whole package when doing
«make». A first look into it shows the basic scheme of all
BID-makefiles: After setting «§(PKGDIR)» and «§(L4DIR)» you add your
commands, and finally a macro-file is included. We refer to the
macro-file as \emph{role file}, as this file determines a distinct
role of the current directory. The purpose of «§(PKGDIR)» is just to
propagate various make commands, which is achieved by the subdir role.
Fortunately, its default behavior meets our needs, and we need no
additional commands.

As you want to create a server, switch into the «server/» directory. 
There is already another makefile, very similar to the one you just
looked at. Note the modified «§(PKGDIR)» assignment, as the package
dir is one level up now. Go ahead into the «src/» directory, where you
finally place your source code.

The makefile prepared in this directory creates executable binaries. 
Optionally, it uploads them to your file-server (tftp at TUD), so you
can boot it right afterwards over the network. If you did not do it
already, this is a good time to fix the paths for later uploading the
binaries to your file server (see Section~\ref{sec:bootbin} for
details).

The makefile in «server/src» expects your code in the file «main.c»
(which we could change, of course), so edit this file.

|~/src/l4/pkg/hiworld/server/src> xemacs main.c|

The file prepared already has an empty «main()» function. Add a
«printf("Hi world")»:

\examplefile{hiworld/server/src/main.c}{hi-simple.c}

Compile the program:

|~/src/l4/pkg/hiworld/server/src> make|

This will create a directory («OBJ-x86_586-l4v2/») where all compiled
files will go. You will find the compiled binary in this
directory, its name is the name of the package: «hiworld». The binary
is also installed into «§(L4DIR)/bin». If you did the setup for
installing the binaries (see Section~\ref{sec:bootbin}), it should be
installed on your file server this way, and hence is ready for booting
over the network already. To execute it, boot L4 together with the
essential servers. Use the following «menu.lst file» after adapting
the paths to the binaries.

\examplefile{menu.lst}{hi-menu.lst}

If all went right (you installed an L4 version 2 micro-kernel named
\emph{fiasco} into «§(L4DIR)/bin», and installed all the other
binaries as well; your boot loader found all the files; your test
machine executed the micro kernel and the applications), you should
see the 'Hi world' near the bottom of the screen attached to your test
node.

You may also run your application using Fiasco-UX (refer to
Section~\ref{sec:fiascoux} for instructions on building and using). The
respective start script is:

\examplefile{hello}{hi-runux}

In this section we
\BI
\IT created a new package
\IT wrote code printing ``hi world''
\IT compiled and installed the program, so the file-server could find
it
\IT booted L4 to execute our native hello world program
\EI

\section{Hello world server}

In this section, we create a server that reacts to commands of a
client. For generating the code for communication between server and
client we use an IDL compiler.

Our server should offer two services, one is to output the well-known
``Hi world'' string, and another is to return the number of calls to
the former function.

\subsection{IDL file}

We start with writing a corresponding IDL file. Therefore, switch
into «§(PKGDIR)/idl/» and create the file «hiworld.idl»:

\examplefile{hiworld/idl/hiworld.idl}{hi-idl}

Modify the prepared makefile to assign the IDL file to the variable
IDL, and to ask the IDL compiler to generate server skeletons. The
skeletons will help us later to insert our code:

\examplefile{hiworld/idl/Makefile}{hi-idl-makefile}

Generate the C sources by calling make:

|~/src/l4/pkg/hiworld/idl> make|

If your IDL compiler was installed correctly, you end up with the
directory «OBJ-x86_586-l4v2» containing the C sources for IPC
communication between client and server. For details on the IDL file
syntax, the meaning of the command line switches or the generated
source code, please see the documentation of the IDL compiler
\name{dice}, which you can build yourself in «§(L4DIR)/tool/dice/doc/»
or find it in \cite{dice-man}.


\subsection{Server side}

Next we implement the server-side functionality. Copy the generated
skeleton file into the already known «server/src/» directory.

|~/src/l4/pkg/hiworld/idl> cp OBJ-x86_586-l4v2/hiworld-template.c \|
|    ../server/src/server.c|

Modify the functions so they do what we want, write code that
registers at the DROPS name server and calls the main server loop:

\examplefile{hiworld/server/src/server.c}{hi-server.c}

We still have to tell BID that we want to compile another binary,
containing the IDL server code and our implementation. Modify the
makefile the following way:

\examplefile{hiworld/server/src/Makefile}{hi-server-makefile}

You are ready to compile the server. BID knows where to find the
files generated by the IDL compiler and arranges the include paths and
additional object files for you.

|~/src/l4/pkg/hiworld/server/src> make|

If there are any problems, they are likely caused by typos, as
your installation has already been proved correct in the previous
steps.

\subsection{Client helper library}

Let us build a client library that encapsulates calls to the hello
world server. The library will be made available for other packages by
BID, so any package can use the library for easy communicating with
the hello world server.

The functions exported by the library will be declared as prototypes
in an include file. The include file will also be made available for
other packages by BID. Let us create the include file first. Switch to
the «§(PKGDIR)/include/» directory and create the new file «hiworld.h»:

\examplefile{hiworld/include/hiworld.h}{hi-include}

The prepared makefile installs all include files in the directory
tree, so that other packages can use them. Our newly created file will
be accessed with «\#include <l4/hiworld/hiworld.h>» later:

|~/src/l4/pkg/hiworld/include> make|

Client libraries are typically build in the «§(PKGDIR)/lib/» directory of a
package. Like in the server directory, there is a «src/» subdirectory. 
Switch into it and create the new file «encap.c» containing the
encapsulation code:

\examplefile{hiworld/lib/src/encap.c}{hi-lib.c}

The makefile in this directory is already prepared to create
libraries. We still have to specify which files go into it. BID also
knows about generated IDL client files, the according make variable is
«§(CLIENTIDL)»:

\examplefile{hiworld/lib/src/Makefile}{hi-lib-makefile}

Finally, build the library and install it, so others can use it:

|~/src/l4/pkg/hiworld/lib/src> make|


\subsection{Client side}
\label{sec:helloserver.client}

The last piece is the client program actually triggering the actions
at the server. We see it as an example on how to use our hello world
server, and consequently place it into the «§(PKGDIR)/examples/» directory tree.
Create a new subdirectory there:

|~/src/l4/pkg/hiworld/examples> mkdir client|

Switch into it and create the source file «main.c» for sending
requests to our server:

\examplefile{hiworld/example/client/main.c}{hi-client.c}

Create a makefile that compiles a binary, and tell BID to link the
client library created in Section~\ref{sec:helloserver.client}.

\examplefile{hiworld/example/client/Makefile}{hi-client-makefile}

Compile the program:

|~/src/l4/pkg/hiworld/examples/client> make|


\subsection{Execution}

To execute the code, you need to boot L4 together with the
essential servers, your hello world server and the hello world client. 
Adapt and add the following text to the «menu.lst» file you already
created in Section~\ref{sec:first.hello}:

\examplefile{menu.lst}{hi-menu.lst.server}

Now boot the new configuration on your test machine. If all went right
you should see the ``Hi world'' issued by the server and a ``Hello
world server returned 1.'' issued by the client near the bottom of the
screen attached to your test machine.


\subsection{Closing remarks}

With the current version of the makefile in the «examples/» directory,
our example is only built upon explicit make request in
«examples/client/». You should modify it to propagate a «make» in the
package directory, as it is done for all the other directories
automatically. Thus it becomes:

\examplefile{hiworld/examples/Makefile}{hi-examples-makefile}

Now, you could do a «make» in «hiworld/» to rebuild your whole package
(probably nothing actually gets built, as everything should
be up to date). Or, you could do a «make clean» in «hiworld/» to
delete all generated intermediate files in your package and only keep
the generated library and the binaries. A «make cleanall» removes
these too.

Note, that BID takes care of build dependencies very carefully. If a
source-file is changed, a «make» in this directory rebuilds everything
in this directory that depends on this file. BID also notices modified
makefiles and client libraries being linked to binaries.

If you trigger a make at the root of a directory tree, BID generally
brings the tree up to date, but never builds anything outside this
tree. For example, you build a package by doing a «make» in its
package directory. However, if it requires include files of libraries
from other packages, you must either build them before, or go into the
«§(L4DIR)/pkg» directory and trigger the make there.

In this section we
\BI
\IT used an IDL compiler to generate IPC communication code
\IT used an include file to propagate prototypes and defines to
    users of our package
\IT created a server implementing the server side of the IDL
\IT created a library allowing clients to communicate with our server
\IT created a client program using that library to communicate with
    the server
\IT learned about dependencies and recursive make invocation
\EI


\section{Installing binaries for booting}
\label{sec:bootbin}

BID can automatically install your compiled binaries so you can boot
them later using the network. Therefore, after compilation binaries
are stripped and copied into «§(L4DIR)/bin» per default. Make this a
symbolic link to your actual file server directory, and you are set.

At TUD, this requires two steps: Ensure the tftp server finds the
binaries within your home directory. Then, ensure the binaries are
installed into this directory. Thus at \emph{os.inf.tu-dresden.de}:

|os:/home/yourname> mkdir -p boot|\\
|os:/home/yourname> ln -s boot /tftpboot/yourname|

(The latter step may require administrator rights, ask the administrator in
this case.) At your \emph{workstation}, where os-home:/home is mounted
(we assume /home to be the mountpoint):

|~/src/l4> ln -s bin /home/YOURNAME/boot/bin|

\pagebreak
\section{Using Fiasco-UX to run L4 applications}
\label{sec:fiascoux}

Fiasco can be build to run as Linux user application -- Fiasco-UX. The steps
to build Fiasco-UX you may obtain from the Fiasco-UX homepage
\cite{fiasco-ux}.

To simplify running application we provide a set of scripts that wrap the
typical options of Fiasco-UX. Please check out «l4/tool/runux». Change into
that directory and edit the file hello.

\examplefile{hello}{hi-runux}

This script will start Fiasco-UX with the basic servers required by the hello
binary. These servers you have already seen in the Grub boot list. To start
the hiserver/hiclient example simply replace the line containing hiworld with
respective lines for hiserver and hiclient.

\section{FAQ}

\newcommand{\faqQ}[1]{\textbf{Q:} & #1 \\[.4ex]}
\newcommand{\faqA}[1]{\textbf{A:} & #1 \\\\}

\begin{descriptiontable}{\textbf{Q:}}
 \faqQ{ We might want to specify the exact CPU types we want to
        build a target for. example: watchdog example of l4util.
        However, this must be linked against the according libraries,
        which may be not available. Do we have CPU-dependent
        libraries, that should be linked  against other libraries? Or:
        Do we want to provide libraries that should be used with
        different CPU types?}
 \faqA{ No, we have one library for every CPU type.}

 \faqQ{ We want to build several packages with \emph{and} without l4api
        support, such as the l4util package. The parse_cmdline stuff
        is independent of the binding, l4_sleep is not. }
 \faqA{ This must be split into two libraries, one with l4api support
        and one without. Use the system-specific «§(TARGET_system)»
        variables to define which library should be built for which system.
        Then, use the target-specific «§(SRC_C_target)» variables to
        define which source-files go into which library. }

 \faqQ{ I want to use an own CRT0, and use "CRT0=mycrt0.o". But
        mycrt0.o is not built automatically. }
 \faqA{ This is right. The CRT0 variable references an
        external object already built. You probably want to use
        "SRC_S=mycrt0.S" (if its assembler). Set "CRT0=" to prevent
        the standard crt0's to be linked. }

 \faqQ{ I need my own linker to link a specific binary. But BID uses §(CC). }
 \faqA{ Set the CC variable target-dependent. If your target is
        mytarget and your favorite linker is mylinker, use
        "mytarget: CC=mylinker". }

 \faqQ{ Why is mconfig not supported? }
 \faqA{ «mconfig» is another Linux configuration tool. It has no help,
        and provides only one menu-like user-interface, which is not
        very handy. }
