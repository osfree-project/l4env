Text styles
###########

Plain text looks like this.

Paragraph 1 is here.

; comments between paragraphs are not a problem 

Paragraph 2 should be here.

Use 'apostrophes for monospaced text', but #hash# works too for compatibility.

Trigger bug in newline handling:

BUG appears if a new line starts with non-words.

BUG this should be a new paragraph, but it is'nt.
(because of the bracket)

_Just_emphasize_this_point_ but only this point.

Trigger bug in emph: (_BUG_) - *GOTCHA* This bug is no more.
What about this one: (_BUG0_,_BUG1_)?

* itemize is nice.
* what do you think?
  * Yes?
  * No?
  * Maybe!

# Let's enumerate some points.
# Test point


:Description: Use this "for descriptions."
  The "description" continues here...

  and here.

:Advice: Watch the step!


Trigger bug in itemize newline handling:

BUG paragraph one

BUG paragraph two

BUG paragraph three
* item 1
* item 2
BUG paragraph four


!Whole line is verbatim. Maybe used for sources ...
!/** MAIN */
!void main(void) {
!    exit(0);

[table accentuations full-span]

Please not that you need a _space_ in the line between table [LABEL] and 
[TABLE2] in the source representation. Table [accentuations] shows
italic, bold, and monospaced styles.
;Is it correct that this text is indented?

More Text for Tab. [LABEL] follows here.


Images

_TODO_

;; usage as follows
;; <image_file_without_extension> will be label with some things
;; stripped of (e.g. '_')

Underlines in Latex citations text [xaz_123] text

There was a bug where an
'apostroph' caused the start of a new paragraph.

There was also a bug where a
[reference] caused the start of a new paragraph.

There was even a bug where a
"quotes" caused the start of a new paragraph.

Just to test, how -- and --- are handled by the backend.
BTW, what happens when they appear inside [refer --- ences]?

Test for monospaced text within quotes
######################################

here comes "'some quoted monospaced text'" does it work?

here comes "#some quoted monospaced text#" with a hash?

here comes "_some_quoted italic text_"

here comes "*some quoted bold text*" followed by some normal text.

Text after image without empty line
###################################

'bla.png' is missing.
;[image bla.png]
This is some plain text that was wrongly assigned to the
caption of the image.

Accentuations
#############

Monospaced and 'non'-monospaced connected by a hyphen.

Accentuation of 'IPCmon''s name.

This works
