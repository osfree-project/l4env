This directory contains shell scripts (or examples) for Fiasco-UX.

Users need to have a "config.local" file for their configuration, a
template can be found in the config.template file.

con    - Runs con_demo1 in the console system
dope   - Runs DOpE with vscrtest, a DOpE sample application
fiasco - fast starter for Fiasco-UX, use fiasco hello (yes, without -l)
l4env  - similar to fiasco but always launch some l4env servers
lx     - Run L4Linux, use lx -h to get some help on this script
lx_cd  - Run L4Linux and use the Demo CD file system, use:
             DEMOCD=/path/to/image ./lx_cd ...
run    - Start the console, the loader and run.

Exit a Fiasco-UX session with Ctrl-C and '^'.
